Summary
Bugfix - Update the admin user role assignment to enforce the config:
Bugfix - Crash when processing crafted TIFF files:
Bugfix - Update reva to v2.19.5:
Bugfix - Fix infected file handling:
Details
Bugfix - Update the admin user role assignment to enforce the config:
The admin user role assigment was not updated after the first assignment. We now
read the assigned role during init and update the admin user ID accordingly if
the role is not assigned. This is especially needed when the OCIS_ADMIN_USER_ID
is set after the autoprovisioning of the admin user when it originates from an
external Identity Provider.
Bugfix - Crash when processing crafted TIFF files:
Fix for a vulnerability with low severity in disintegration/imaging.
GHSA-q7pp-wcgr-pffx

Bugfix - Update the admin user role assignment to enforce the config:
Bugfix - Crash when processing crafted TIFF files:
Bugfix - Update reva to v2.19.5:
Bugfix - Fix infected file handling:
Details
Bugfix - Update the admin user role assignment to enforce the config:
The admin user role assigment was not updated after the first assignment. We now
read the assigned role during init and update the admin user ID accordingly if
the role is not assigned. This is especially needed when the OCIS_ADMIN_USER_ID
is set after the autoprovisioning of the admin user when it originates from an
external Identity Provider.
Bugfix - Crash when processing crafted TIFF files:
Fix for a vulnerability with low severity in disintegration/imaging.

2234: Dolt should not support subqueries in the WHERE clause of UPDATE statements
The following schema is used in the tests:
CREATE TABLE t1 (id INT);
INSERT INTO t1 (id) VALUES (1), (2);
UPDATE t1 SET id = 3 WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM t1 WHERE id = 1);
This results in the following error:
ERROR 1173 (42000): Incorrect usage of read-only statement features (non-read-only transaction or statement is not allowed in read-only transaction)
If I run the same query against a MySQL server, it runs fine.
Also, if I change the query to:
UPDATE t1 SET id = 3 WHERE id = 1;
It runs fine in Dolt.
It's possible that Dolt is trying to do something more complicated than it needs to be, but I'm not sure.","Merged PRs

The weather is getting warmer and I think we can all enjoy a new refreshment in the form of a Preact release! The past weeks saw a good chunk of bug fixes and a bit of house keeping. Upgrades should be as straightforward as swapping out the version number in package.json and running npm install or yarn install once!
Introducing prefresh (experimental)
It was one of those miracle days where all the pieces fell into place just perfectly: @JoviDeCroock got a HMR (=hot module reloading) prototype up without any changes to Preact and running in a couple hours! With the biggset achievement being that it works amazingly well in keeping hooks state around.
Since then he was contacted by various maintainers of bundlers to collaborate on an ideal developer experience. Today, about a little more than a week later we have them ready to be tested. And we need your feedback to make it the best HMR experience we can! Please file any issue you come across!

Preact sightings
Recently deno cut it's 1.0.0 release which is a huge achievement. It's a new spin on what node could look like if it would have started fresh in 2019 and we're excited where this experiment will lead to! Despite it being very early it made some waves in our community and we were filled with joy when we noticed that the website is built with our beloved framework!

"This release includes bug fixes and enhancements to the flow run date range picker on the flow runs page, as well as the prefect deploy CLI command.
See the release notes for details!","This release brings some exciting enhancements and fixes!
Enhanced UI Customization
Now featuring relative time spans like ""Past 7 days"" for better insight into current and upcoming flow runs across the UI.
Flow Runs Page: Enhanced with customizable date and time filters. Save custom filters with specific date ranges for tailored views
Flows Page: Updated with similar date and time filtering capabilities
See a demonstration here!
Get type-checked input from humans in the loop
Human-in-the-loop flows just got an upgrade. You can now pause or suspend a flow and wait for type-checked input. To get started, declare the structure of the input data using a Pydantic model, and Prefect will render a form dynamically in the UI when a human resumes the flow. Form validation will ensure that the data conforms to your Pydantic model, and your flow will receive tbe input.
Prefect's new RunInput class powers this experience. RunInput is a subclass of Pydantic's BaseModel. Here's an example of a RunInput that uses dates, literals, and nested Pydantic models to show you what's possible:
class Person(RunInput):
first_name: str
last_name: str
birthday: datetime.date
likes_tofu: bool
age: int = Field(gt=0, lt=150)
shirt_size: Literal[ShirtSize.SMALL, ShirtSize.MEDIUM, ShirtSize.LARGE,
ShirtSize.XLARGE]
shirt_color: Literal[""red"", ""blue"", ""green""]
preferred_delivery_time: datetime.datetime
shipping_address: ShippingAddress
billing_address: BillingAddress | SameAsShipping = Field(
title="""", default_factory=SameAsShipping
Check out our guide on how to create human-in-the-loop flows to learn more!

"Improvements to eye tracking plugin
New subscribe mechanism for receiving gaze data in real-time
Fix bug in jsPsych.pluginAPI.compareKeys that resulted in an error when either argument was null","This minor release is focused on improvements to the eye tracking features added in version 6.3.0.
New Features
We have forked WebGazer to make some minor changes to improve compatibility with jsPsych. These changes allow jsPsych to sample eye movements at a faster rate without disrupting jsPsych's display timing. Thanks to @moltaire for identifying this issue ().
WebGazer no longer initializes automatically when the page loads. Instead, the webgazer-init-camera plugin will initialize WebGazer and ask for camera access permissions. Added an auto_initialize parameter to the WebGazer extension to allow users to initialize on page load if desired.
The sampling interval can be set in the WebGazer extension. By default the extension aims for 30Hz. Faster intervals are probably not possible until browsers provide better interfaces to synchronize processing with video feeds.
Improved the timing measurements reported by WebGazer by ~30 milliseconds. Timing is now based on an estimate of when the video frame was recorded, instead of when WebGazer finished computational work on the video frame.
jsPsych.pluginAPI.compareKeys can now handle null values: it will return true if both key arguments are null, and return false if one key is null and the other is a key code or key character. This means that this function can be used to check for a correct non-response. ()
Changes
Minor formatting and text updates to the webgazer-init-camera plugin to center the camera view.
The webgazer-validate plugin now records the coordinates of the validation points.
The webgazer-init-camera plugin now records the load time for WebGazer to initialize.
Added a point_size parameter to calibration and validation plugins, and set the default to a larger value.
Bug Fixes
Fixed an issue where webgazer_targets did not record the bounding box of content on the screen if the content was loaded after the trial began.
Fixed problem with the minimum_valid_rt parameter in jsPsych.init not working when the WebAudio clock is used to measure keyboard RTs (i.e. rt_method: 'audio' in jsPsych.pluginAPI.getKeyboardResponse). Thanks @kinleyid! ()
Fixed various documentation errors and formatting problems. ()",3,2,4,4

"Adds ExplainerHub, a service for serving explainer models
Makes waitress the default server","New Features
Introducing ExplainerHub: combine multiple dashboards together behind a single frontend with convenient url paths.
code example:
db1 = ExplainerDashboard(explainer, title=""Dashboard One"", name='db1')
db2 = ExplainerDashboard(explainer2, title=""Dashboard Two"", name='project_alpha', description=""New proposed model"")
hub = ExplainerHub([db1, db2])
hub.run()
# store an recover from config:
hub.to_yaml(""hub.yaml"")
hub2 = ExplainerHub.from_config(""hub.yaml"")
adds option dump_explainer to ExplainerDashboard.to_yaml() to automatically
dump the explainer along with the .yaml.
adds option use_waitress to ExplainerDashboard.run() and ExplainerHub.run(), to use the waitress python webserver instead of the Flask development server
adds parameters to ExplainerDashboard:
name: this will be used to assign a url for ExplainerHub (otherwise defaults to dashboard1, dashboard2, etc
description: this will be used for the title tooltip in the dashboard
and in the ExplainerHub frontend.
Improvements
the cli now uses the waitress server by default.",3,5,4,5

Security upgrade org.jsoup:jsoup to 1.15.3
Commit · Pull request
The following vulnerability are fixed with the upgrade: https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGJSOUP-2989728
Important Note: Upgrading jsoup from 1.14.3 to 1.15.3 includes an API breaking change and it might prevents the compilation of your code (only if you had a any direct usage of the removed deprecated class org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist). This was necessary to fix the potential security vulnerability listed above, and it is recommended to upgrade to this version. If you happened to have a compile error in your application, simply replace any possible occurrences of org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist with org.jsoup.safety.Safelist and there should not be any other hassles.

"Bug Fixes
: Allow function keys to work if standard select menu is open
: Allow was-validated class to work on select elements without selectpicker class
: Set width of newElement when calculating menu size (fixes issue introduced in v1.13.11 when select has form-control class)
: Remove click listener in checkDisabled that prevents menu from opening if the select is disabled. Bootstrap dropdown already checks for this, and has since v2.0.3.
: Only remove original Bootstrap keydown event listener on bootstrap-select dropdowns (allow keyboard control over normal Bootstrap dropdown components)
: Remove unnecessary var that declaration
: Update precompiled bootstrap link to v3.4.1
: Change search input type from ""search""
