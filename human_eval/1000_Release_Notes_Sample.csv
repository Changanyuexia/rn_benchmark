Fix: Fix access to files withing a public link targeting a space root

public share while not providing a password, the check must be against the new permissions to

miniflux/v2,"Avoid XSS when opening a broken image due to unescaped ServerError in proxy handler (CVE-2023-27592)
Creating an RSS feed item with the inline description containing an <img> tag
with a srcset attribute pointing to an invalid URL like
http:a<script>alert(1)</script>, we can coerce the proxy handler into an error
condition where the invalid URL is returned unescaped and in full.
This results in JavaScript execution on the Miniflux instance as soon as the
user is convinced to open the broken image.
Use r.RemoteAddr to check /metrics endpoint network access (CVE-2023-27591)
HTTP headers like X-Forwarded-For or X-Real-Ip can be easily spoofed. As
such, it cannot be used to test if the client IP is allowed.
The recommendation is to use HTTP Basic authentication to protect the
metrics endpoint, or run Miniflux behind a trusted reverse-proxy.
Add HTTP Basic authentication for /metrics endpoint

Bug Fixes
Fix AST parsing when setup.py contains binary operators other than + and -.
Fix test failures due to updates to the pyparsing API.
Fixed an issue with loading Pipfile data due to plette model misalignment.
Fixed failed calls to .lower on tomlkit's Bool object during pipfile load as the API seems to have changed here.
Added import guards to prevent ImportErrors which could occur when attempting to import now-removed pkg_resources.extern.requirements.
Fixed an issue which prevented loading Lockfile-based references to local paths when calling as_requirements() on a requirementslib.models.lockfile.Lockfile instance.
Updated references to Link instances which no longer have the is_artifact property.
Updated all references to newly shimmed code to fix breakages due to pip 19.3 release:
Fixed references to Command object from pip in favor of InstallCommand which is now properly shimmed via pip-shims
Fixed invocation of VcsSupport and VersionControl objects for compatibility
Removed addition of options to Command as they are redundant when using InstallCommand
Cut get_finder and start_resolver over to newly shimmed approaches in pip-shims
Fixed a bug in parsing of Pipfiles with missing or misnamed source sections which could cause tomlkit errors when loading legacy Pipfiles.
Corrected an unexpected behavior which resulted in a KeyError when attempting to call __getitem__ on a Pipfile instance with a section that was not present.
Fixed an issue in Lockfile path and model auto-detection when called without the load classmethod which caused initialization to fail due to an AttributeError.
Fixed an issue which caused build directories to be deleted before dependencies could be determined for editable source reqiurements.
Fixed a bug which could cause parsing to fail for setup.cfg files on python 2.
Fixed an issue in binary operator mapping in the ast_parse_setup_py functionality of the dependency parser which could cause dependency resolution to fail.
Fixed an issue which prevented successful parsing of setup.py files which were not utf-8` encoded.
Fixed an issue which caused mappings of binary operators to fail to evaluate when parsing setup.py files.
Fixed mapping and evaluation of boolean operators and comparisons when evaluating setup.py files with AST parser to discover dependencies."

timbrel/gitsavvy,"Add ""Make fixup commit"" and ""Show previous tip"" to the rebase menu in the ""Repo History""
The latter is really the easier to use --reflog option which was already available in that view.
Often we only want to see the most recent previous tip after a rebase.  From there, we either
look up the diff against HEAD or maybe reset --hard.
Preparing a fixup commit directly from the ""Repo History"" also feels natural.  Please be sure
you already made the actual fixup, t.i. you changed and saved the code, before entering the
commit phase, otherwise there would be nothing to commit.  (Not that GitSavvy would commit
nothing then, but you would have to go back and redo.)
Quality-of-life improvements:
Automatically assume you want to commit -a if nothing is staged.
Automatically close ""stranded"" diff views after committing. ()"

sensedeep/dynamodb-onetable,"Minor Patch Release
Features
Refactor the uuid, ulid, ksuid params.
More documentation updates.
UUID
Previously there were separate uuid, ulid and ksuid param options. This proliferation was not ideal. While the old syntax is still supported, it is deprecated. The new syntax is:
Schema
models: {
Account: {
id:          { type: String, uuid: 'ulid' },
The schema entity model can set the uuid parameter to true, uuid or ulid. If set to true, that selects the default UUID function defined via the table constructor which may be a UUID, ULID or custom function (or UUID if unset). If set to uuid, it selects the UUID. If set to ulid, it selects the ULID function.
Table Constructor
new Table({
uuid: string | function
The default uuid may be set to 'uuid' or 'ulid' or a custom function.  This defines the default UUID function for entities.

Do not remove expanded items from key mapper ()
Commit · Pull request · Issue
With a TreeGrid, the expanded state of a root item gets lost when scrolled enough to request a new range. The cause for this is the updated key of the returned item. The expanded state for the items except the root items do not get lost. This PR makes sure that the key-value pair for a root item persists in the KeyMapper if the item is expanded. This change only affects hierarchical data. A test is added to ensure that the fix solves the issue. While this refactoring is less than ideal in terms of clean code, I think that the alternative requires a much larger refactoring. The logic in the regular and hierarchical data communicators are mostly both coupled and duplicated with private methods at this time. Therefore, this PR is as atomic as possible.
Remove unnecessary clear condition ()
Commit · Pull request · Issue
For hierarchical data, even when the child components are filtered out, the clear method on ArrayUpdater.Update in HierarchicalCommunicationController is never called. This is caused by an if check, in which the start index of previousActive is compared to the newly calculated assumedSize. Since there might be items to clear, the newly calculated size should have no effect on whether we clear the items or not. This check is not present in the DataCommunicator counterpart within the method collectChangesToSend. This PR removes the aforementioned clear condition. Add test to ensure that the expanded children are cleared properly when filtered out.

hashgraph/hedera-services,"In Hedera Services 0.15.2, we improved performance and integrated with the latest Platform SDK to enable network reconnect.
The performance gains let us augment the Hedera world state with records of all transactions handled in the three minutes of consensus time, even when handling 10k transactions per second. The GetAccountRecords query will now return, from state, the records of all transactions handled in the last 3 minute for which the queried account was the payer.
In this release we also finalized the design for the non-fungible token (NFT) support to be added to the Hedera Token Service (HTS) in release 0.16.0. The protobufs for new HAPI operations are available in the 0.15.0 tag of the official repository, with documentation here.
The CSV format for exported account balances is no longer supported. All mainnet stream file consumers should be fully migrated to the protobuf format of the account balances file.
To simplify fee calculations, there is now a maximum entity lifetime of a century for any entity whose lifetime is not already constrained by the maximum auto-renew period. A HAPI transaction that tries to set an expiration further than a century from the current consensus time will resolve to INVALID_EXPIRATION_TIME.
Enhancements
Improve performance, e.g.
Finalize protobufs for NFT support in HTS

Important Changes
Updated Node to v1.6.0
This is a mandatory update for the upcoming Dakota Crescent upgrade with consensus efficiency improvements. Dakota Crescent upgrade is set for block 733,000 (ETA 25 March 2021). You MUST upgrade before the upgrade block.
Updated app name to ""DeFi Wallet""
We have updated the app name from defi-app to DeFi Wallet. When you install this version, it will create new folders for both installation folder and metadata folder. The Defi (Mac) / DeFi Blockchain (Windows) folder (location of blocks, wallet files etc.) will still be in the same directory.
Auto-update via app for all OS will not work with this release due to app name update. You need to manually download and install the file for this update. For future releases, auto-update via app will work again.
You will have two DeFi apps on your machine when you install this version (defi-app <v2.3.1 and DeFi Wallet >v2.3.2). You have the option to keep the old app or remove it. Just make sure to backup any wallet.dat files before removing any folders.
For Windows users
Do not use the installation folder (C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\defi-app) to store your wallet files. This folder is deleted and created on every manual install/update. If you have any wallet files on this folder, backup your wallet.dat files on a different directory before updating.
You can now choose the installation directory during manual install or auto-update via app.
The new folder defi-wallet & DeFi Blockchain will be used from v2.3.2 onwards.
Snapshot
We're still working on integrating the snapshot on our app. However, if you wish to get the latest snapshot, you can use this link to start syncing at 682097.
To apply the snapshot:
Download the snapshot
Extract all folders inside the Defi (Mac) / DeFi Blockchain (Windows) folder. App must be closed before applying the snapshot.
Open the app
Masternode Management
Masternode management is enabled on this version. You can now create your own masternode in the app. For more details, refer to this notes.

victoriametrics/victoriametrics,"Changes since v1.35.0
ENHANCEMENT: vmagent: add Prometheus-compatible service discovery for Consul aka consul_sd_configs. See .
ENHANCEMENT: vmagent: reload only modified target scrapers on config changes. This should improve scrape stability when big number of targets are scraped and these targets are frequently changed. See .
ENHANCEMENT: vmagent: make consistent scrape time offsets across reloads for the same pair of (ScrapeURL, Labels). This should make consistent intervals between data points for scrape targets across reloads. Previously these intervals were random.
ENHANCEMENT: vmagent: add /-/reload endpoint for online reloading -promscrape.config. This endpoint is similar to Prometheus' one - see https://www.robustperception.io/reloading-prometheus-configuration .
ENHANCEMENT: prevent from app termination on SIGHUP signal, since this signal is frequently used for config reload.
ENHANCEMENT: add -http.pathPrefix command-line flag for adding common prefix to all the paths handled by http server. This flag is similar to --web.external-url from Prometheus. See https://www.robustperception.io/using-external-urls-and-proxies-with-prometheus .
ENHANCEMENT: vmagent: follow a single redirect during target scrape.
ENHANCEMENT: reduce the probability of false-positive not enough memory errors on aggregating queries such as sum(...) by (...).
ENHANCEMENT: set 30 seconds timeout for discovery api requests. Previously such requests could hang for long time. This could make debugging harder.
BUGFIX: align relabeling behaviour to Prometheus when working with empty label values. See
BUGFIX: recover when metricID->metricName entry is missing in the inverted index after unclean shutdown. Newly added index entries can be missing after unclean shutdown, since they didn't flush to persistent storage yet. Log about this and delete the corresponding metricID, so it could be re-created next time.

rkt/rkt,"While the noticeable changes should be minimal, there are a huge number of bug fixes and improvements under the hood which sets us up nicely for a significant v0.9.0 release in the next couple of weeks.
A few notable UX changes in this release:
Arguments can now be passed through to CNI plugins on the command line - see the networking documentation for details
The default metadata service port has been changed from 2375 (which had an unfortunate conflict with an IANA registered/reserved port) to an arbitrary non-registered port, 18112
The APPNAME field in the output of rkt image list has been changed to the more accurate NAME
rkt rm now supports a variable number of arguments, allowing the removal of multiple pods simultaneously
Full list of changes:
New features and UX changes:
rkt rm is now variadic: it can now remove multiple pods in one command, by UUID
The APPNAME column in rkt image list output has been changed to the more accurate NAME. This involves a schema change in rkt's on-disk datastore, but this should be upgraded transparently.
Headers are now sent when following HTTP redirects while trying to retrieve an image
The default metadata service port number was changed from a registered/reserved IANA port to an arbitrary port in the non-dynamic range
Added the ability to override arguments for network plugins
rkt will now error out if someone attempts to use --private-users with the lkvm backend
Bug fixes:
Fixed creation of /tmp in apps' root filesystems with correct permissions
Fixed garbage collection after umounts (for example, if a system reboots before a pod is cleanly destroyed)
Fixed a race in interactive mode when using the lkvm backend that could cause a deadlock or segfault
Fixed bad parameter being passed to the metadata service (""uid"" -> ""uuid"")
Fixed setting of file permissions during stage1 set up
Fixed a potential race condition during simultaneous iptables invocation
Fixed ACI download progress being sent to stderr instead of stdout, now consistent with the output during retrieval of Docker images
rkt help prepare will now show the correct default stage1 image
rkt will refuse to add isolators with nil Limits, preventing a panic caused by an ambiguity in upstream appc schema
Other changes:
Reworked the SELinux implementation to use systemd-nspawn's native context-switching feature
Added a workaround for a bug in Docker <1.8 when it is run on the same system as rkt (see (comment))
Added a rkt-xxxx-tapN name to tap devices that rkt creates
Functional tests now clean intermediate images between tests
Countless improvements and cleanup to the build system
Numerous documentation improvements, including splitting out all top-level rkt subcommands into their own documents"

prefecthq/prefect,"This release builds on 2.10 to further improve the experience of setting up and deploying from a prefect project.  In particular, initializing a project with a recipe now starts an interactive CLI experience that guides you to a correct setup.  This experience can be avoided for programmatic initialization by providing all required fields for the recipe via CLI.  For more information, see the project documentation.  We will continue to enhance the deployment experience as we receive feedback, so please keep it coming!
This release also includes a critical fix for Prefect logs that were sometimes delayed in being sent to the API.

Deprecations
Preprocessing option in our babel plugin
The preprocess option was never here to stay and its experiment has essentially proven to be insufficient for our future goals. Check out Sweetsour/ISTF for our current effort of making styled-components more performant and adding a CSS pipeline to it: https://github.com/kitten/sweetsour
Thanks to @Samatar26 for his PR!
Changes
Add process.env.SC_ATTR to override our style tag's marker attribute
While we're figuring out how to improve our context-drive StyleSheetManager in a stable way that works with SSR and sharded stylesheets, we would still like to provide a way for you to use styled-components that enables widgets and other use-cases where it might be necessary to prevent us from destroying your stylesheet on pages.
Specifically this affects people who are building non-SSR code that runs on pages where styled-components is already in place. In these cases our SSR rehydration would go along and happily remove another module's style tags. We haven't considered this closely as it is not a good practice in our eyes to run duplicated styled-components modules in a single app. But when you're not dealing with a single app only it might make sense.
You can now change the the style tag's styled-components attribute by bundling with the SC_ATTR environment variable. Given a setup where you can set this variable, we will now inject style tags with a different attribute, so that they're not affected by the standard SSR rehydration.
Documentation will follow soon; Thanks to @Fer0x for this change!"

Better analysis of when dealing with unknown types
Prior to this release, Psalm wouldn't see any problems with the following:
class A {}
function foo($bar) : void {
if (rand(0, 1)) {
$bar = new A();
That's because $bar would always be treated as mixed. mixed is a special type that basically says ""we don't know anything"", but if we look at the code above it's clear that it might fail.
I changed Psalm's type system so that mixed no longer subsumes any other possible type, and now the above reports a PossiblyUndefinedMethod issue.
New compact output
@erunion resolved, which asked for a more concise output format.
Use --output-format=compact to see the new format.
class_alias support

evanw/esbuild,"Support chunk and asset file name templates ()
This release introduces the --chunk-names= and --asset-names= flags. These flags let you customize the output paths for chunks and assets within the output directory. Each output path is a template and currently supports these placeholders:
[name]: The original name of the file. This will be chunk for chunks and will be the original file name (without the extension) for assets.
[hash]: The content hash of the file. This is not necessarily stable across different esbuild versions but will be stable within the same esbuild version.
For example, if you want to move all chunks and assets into separate subdirectories, you could use --chunk-names=chunks/[name]-[hash] and --asset-names=assets/[name]-[hash]. Note that the path template should not include the file extension since the file extension is always automatically added to the end of the path template.
Additional name template features are planned in the future including a [dir] placeholder for the relative path from the outbase directory to the original input directory as well as an --entry-names= flag, but these extra features have not been implemented yet.
Handle this in class static field initializers ()
When you use this in a static field initializer inside a class statement or expression, it references the class object itself:
class Foo {
static Bar = class extends this {
assert(new Foo.Bar() instanceof Foo)
This case previously wasn't handled because doing this is a compile error in TypeScript code. However, JavaScript does allow this so esbuild needs to be able to handle this. This edge case should now work correctly with this release.
Do not warn about dynamic imports when .catch() is detected ()
Previously esbuild avoids warning about unbundled import() expressions when using the try { await import(_) } pattern, since presumably the try block is there to handle the run-time failure of the import() expression failing. This release adds some new patterns that will also suppress the warning: import(_).catch(_), import(_).then(_).catch(_), and import(_).then(_, _).
CSS namespaces are no longer supported
CSS namespaces are a weird feature that appears to only really be useful for styling XML. And the world has moved on from XHTML to HTML5 so pretty much no one uses CSS namespaces anymore. They are also complicated to support in a bundler because CSS namespaces are file-scoped, which means:
Default namespaces can be different in different files, in which case some default namespaces would have to be converted to prefixed namespaces to avoid collisions.
Prefixed namespaces from different files can use the same name, in which case some prefixed namespaces would need to be renamed to avoid collisions.
Instead of implementing all of that for an extremely obscure feature, CSS namespaces are now just explicitly not supported. The code to handle @namespace has been removed from esbuild. This will likely not affect anyone, especially because bundling code using CSS namespaces with esbuild didn't even work correctly in the first place."

appsmithorg/appsmith,"What’s new
D as in December. D as in dynamic menus. D as in delight.
Page URLs change, fetch is now in, and you can soon embed Appsmith apps into a web page, another app, or wherever else but we will talk about that with more excitement later in December.
Features
Dynamic items in the Menu Button now make showing data-dependent menu options easy. Feels like auto-magic minus the AI hype. []
Replace page1, page2, and so on in the URL with something simpler, cooler, or familiar. []
Context menus for your apps and pages plus a button in Properties show a new Settings pane that houses Page settings.
Newer Appsmith versions with the URL structure app.appsmith.com/app/app-name/page1-5m1t7gr34t4pp54pp54pp5m1t75 will let you customize page URLs.
Appsmith versions that have the very old URL structure app.appsmith.com/applications/638eb6e21ef6bf1af9d43a23/pages/638eb6e21ef6bf1af9d43a25 will ask you to switch to newer versions before you can change URLs.
“Go, fetch”, we now say to each other often at Appsmith. To you, we say, “fetch is now enabled in Appsmith.  Go crazy with it!” []
Embedding’s coming soon! []
Improvements
Creating a new datasource without config details doesn’t save it now so you don’t have to grind teeth when deleting a bunch of Untitled datasources. []
Bug fixes
Speaking of datasources and teeth grinding, creating an Untitled datasource on Git connected-apps doesn’t move the branch you chose to Main. []
Using several Google Sheets as datasources in the same app doesn’t show an unexpected and confusing list of tabs from all those sheets anymore. []
How can we go a release without talking up the Table? :-) []
The Table’s filters don’t reset anymore when the data on it changes, resulting in less furrowed foreheads and the beginnings of a smile.
Cursors don’t jump to the beginning of a cell you are editing with In-line editing turned on, leading to slightly wider smiles.
Save and Discard don’t show up in Filters, you don’t click them, the Table doesn’t crash. Results in ear-to-ear grins.
Without starting a debate about modals and how they are the dark cloud over good web design principles, we are glad to report Auto-height for widgets inside a modal doesn’t break the modal itself. []
Oh, and we fixed two minor nits with min-max drags on other Auto-height-enabled widgets while we were fixing modals.
Dragging the bottom edge of a widget inside a container or another widget to change the first widget’s size irritatingly selected the parent widget. That supremacy of the parent is now gone and children can flourish on their own. []
If flickers on TV aren’t great, they are certainly worse when dragging min to max and making them the same values. Clear canvases now. []
The Text widget inside Modals and Stats Boxes was lying to you about its default font size. It now speaks the truth, only the truth, and nothing but the truth, at least about its fonts’ sizes. []
Not as bad as Google Maps asking you to go through trees or drive through canals but there were unsuccessful callbacks and unhelpful error messages with the geolocation APIs. That’s fixed. All the best with Google Maps IRL, though. []
The Select group of widgets and the Rich Text Editor had their own ideas for label positions. We showed them what the Input widget’s labels looked like and they have agreed that’s better. []
Windows devices didn’t show country flags in the Phone widget. We couldn’t just ask you to restart your machine for this one, so we fixed it. []
View mode now shows the deployed app’s layout instead of the current Edit mode’s. Should make app demos to colleagues and stakeholders less embarrassing. []
A small change in one line of code, a pretty significant boost in performance. []
Failing password resets are Catch-22s. We get that. So, we fixed them. Now you can get back in to find other issues and report them to us. [, []
Ideally, you should set the version number when self-hosting Appsmith, but then ideally, we shouldn’t have shown the wrong error message. With this fix, we are closer to that ideal. []"

Clean Org Data Automation Improved

Fix Install / Refresh Vlocity Base Errors

Add Endpoint to the default event_object_filter values for the Kubernetes Event Monitor.
Update scalyr-agent-2 status -v output to also include process id (pid) of the main agent process and children worker processes in scenarios where the agent is configured with multiple worker processes.
Add a new experimental --systemd-managed flag to the scalyr-agent-2-config tool which converts existing scalyr agent installation to be managed by systemd instead of init.d.
Add support for capturing k8s container names to the kubernetes monitor via log line attributes. Container name can be captured using ${k8s_container_name} config template syntax.
Kubernetes monitor has been updated to log 403 errors when connecting to the Kubernetes API before falling back to the old fallback URL under warning log level. Previously those errors were logged under debug log level which would make it hard to troubleshoot some issues related to missing permissions, etc. since those log messages would only end up in debug log file which is disabled by default.
Bug fixes:
Fix scalyr-agent-status -v to not emit / print warnings under some edge cases.
Fix regression with syslog monitor which caused the ingestion of the file with a wrong parser. The root cause was in the too broad path glob that was used in the agent log's LogMatcher, so it also processed the agent_syslog.log as an agent log file."

reduxjs/redux-toolkit,"This releases fixes our dev UMD build, and improves type inference for dispatch based on provided middleware.
Changes
Dispatch and Middleware Typings
The Redux core types will modify the type of dispatch based on provided middleware, allowing it to accept parameters other than action objects and return other values.  The redux-thunk middleware is an example of this.
RTK's configureStore and getDefaultMiddleware were not correctly picking up the types of the middleware, and were always assuming that redux-thunk was enabled at the type level even if the thunk middleware had been disabled.
This has been fixed, and the store should now correctly pick up the types of both the default and user-provided middleware.
Additional Type Re-Exports
RTK now re-exports the ThunkAction type from redux-thunk, and the Draft type from immer.
Dev UMD fixes
Our dev UMD build was broken due to the recent build configuration changes, and that has now been fixed.  This means the sandbox in the Basic Tutorial should be working again.
Changelog
correctly infer dispatch from provided middlewares (@phryneas -)
export ThunkAction and Draft types (@phryneas -)

cosmos/cosmos-sdk,"This release introduces bug fixes and improvements in the Cosmos SDK v0.44 series.
SDK v0.44.0-v0.44.3 x/auth migration has a vesting account bug, which vanishes delegated_vesting field from BaseVestingAccount. Recovery, unfortunately, is complicated and either involves manually overwriting it or querying an old state.
We had to change the order of module migration by pushing x/auth to the end. Auth module state depends on x/stake and should be run last. We have updated the documentation to provide more details how to change module migration order. This is technically a breaking change, but only impacts updates between the major version change, hence migrating from the previous patch release (0.44.x) doesn't cause new migration and doesn't break the state.
Other bug fixes:
grpc-gateway query account balance by IBC denom had an incorrect endpoint (correct one is ""/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/balances/{address}/by_denom"")
use sdk.GetConfig().GetFullBIP44Path() instead sdk.FullFundraiserPath to generate key - this correctly resets hdpath when running app testnet.
This release enables Auto Download feature for Cosmovisor >= v1.0.0. Now, you will be able to use Auto Download with the latest Cosmovisor when you will plan the next upgrade to the next major release (v0.45.0),
Finally, we updated the IAVL to v0.17.2 and take a benefit of the new IAVL iterator, which improves the iteration performance.
See the Cosmos SDK v0.44.4 Changelog for the exhaustive list of all changes.

cakephp/cakephp,"The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP 3.4.10. This is a maintenance release for the 3.4 branch that fixes several community reported issues.
Bugfixes & New Features
You can expect the following changes in 3.4.10. See the changelog for every commit.
Sessions now work with trans_sid enabled.
Inspecting queries with Xdebug no longer causes lastInsertId() to return the incorrect results.
Validation error messages when Email addresses are invalid are more helpful  now.
FormHelper can now read values from entity properties that implement  ArrayAccess.
ConsoleIo::overwrite() can now overwrite long content with shorter content correctly.
Several compatibility issues with PHP 7.2 were fixed.
Digest Authentication can now compare the digest hash even when the field is  hidden in the entity.
Associations contained in beforeFind events are now retained on cloned queries.
MO file parsing correctly handles Plural-Forms: nplurals=1; plural=0;.
Http\Client now handles redirects instead of the Stream adapter handling  them. This resolves an issue where cookies sent in intermediary responses were not being forwarded in subsequent requests.
The validation package no longer has a hard dependency on cakephp/i18n.

reduxjs/redux-toolkit,"This bugfix release includes tweaks to RTKQ options handling, tweaks for perf updates, dependency updates, and updates to our CI tooling.
Also, please check out our ongoing RTK 2.0 alpha releases! They have significant improvements to bundle size, ESM/CJS compatibility, TS typings, and reducer update performance.  We're looking for real-world feedback on behavior, performance, and any issues you might run into.
Changelog
RTK Query Options Updates
Passing transformResponse as part of enhanceEndpoints can now override the TS type of the original data.
fetchBaseQuery now properly checks for a global responseHandler option.
Performance and Internals
RTK Query now uses Immer's original() to do comparisons inside of copyWithStructuralSharing, which should significantly speed up performance when applying changes from re-fetched data.
RTKQ's internal subscriptionUpdated action is now marked as batchable.
We've updated dependencies to Immer 9.0.21, Reselect 4.1.8, and Redux 4.2.1.
CI Updates
We've added a suite of example apps built with different frameworks such as CRA 4, CRA 5, Next, and Vite, as well as examples that check for compatibility in Node with CJS and ESM modes and with various TS module resolution modes.

timmo001/home-panel,"Full Changelog
Changed
add edit config dialog
reduce UI updates
fix layout
handle hass connection errors
allow to disable time and date in the header
This version requires an update to API v0.3.1
I have created a configuration UI to edit your config.json from the web! No more syntax errors or trying to figure out what goes where. Obviously, if you prefer to use JSON you still can, from the api like usual. (be sure to report any bugs you find to the issue tracker)
I have tweaked the UI, adding animations, fixing margins, position issues etc.
You can also disable time and date to reduce the size of the header further.
Breaking change
There is one change to the config, which moves date format to the date object. See: https://git.timmo.xyz/home-panel/configuration/#date"

dagster.readthedocs.io is currently stale due to availability issues.
New
Improvements to S3 Resource. (Thanks @dwallace0723!)
Better error messages in Dagit.
Better font/styling support in Dagit.
Changed OutputDefinition to take is_required rather than is_optional argument. This is to
remain consistent with changes to Field in 0.7.1 and to avoid confusion
with python's typing and dagster's definition of Optional, which indicates None-ability,
rather than existence. is_optional is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Added support for Flower in dagster-k8s.
Added support for environment variable config in dagster-snowflake.
Bugfixes
Improved performance in Dagit waterfall view.
Fixed bug when executing solids downstream of a skipped solid.
Improved navigation experience for pipelines in Dagit.
Fixed for the dagster-aws CLI tool.

marechj/hll_rcon_tool,"v8.0.1 Working Endpoint Permissions
If you are upgrading from an older release than the latest, review all the previous release instructions to make sure you upgrade correctly. Especially because .env is no longer part of the repo, make sure you make a copy if you're on an older version
Endpoint permissions are applied as of this release, and the bug that was causing kicks/bans/etc. to not work correctly has been fixed.
If you are upgrading from v7.2.1 and you haven't applied permissions to your users, review the previous release announcements.
Upgrade instructions
.env is no longer part of the repo, so now upgrading is very easy!
RCONWEB_SERVER_URL must be set for EACH of your servers in your .env or the admin site will throw CSRF errors because we upgraded Django versions.
If you changed your TAGGED_VERSION in your .env to downgrade, change it back to latest
git fetch --tags
git checkout v8.0.1
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans
Change Notes
Upgraded from Django 3.2 to 4.2
RCONWEB_SERVER_URL is now a mandatory .env setting due to upgrading Django versions
Redis and Postgres images now use their alpine images for reduced disk space usage
extended_commands.py and recorded_rcon.py have been merged into one class/file (rcon.py)
Due to limitations in the RCON protocol, we have increased the buffer size of requested data on game server requests, if your players have names that use multi byte unicode characters, you should see somewhat fewer failed requests
New endpoint get_api_documentation which will show you all of the available API endpoints and what information it can automatically generate from the source code
The get_next_map endpoint now uses the result of get_gamestate instead of trying to guess it (legacy from before the gamestate RCON command was available)
Thanks to @MartijnHols scores (combat effectiveness, support, etc) now show on the stats page and the scoreboards will always generate a valid link to the players steam profile

We hope you will be pleased with this new version!
Caddy is on feature freeze until after 2.8 so we can improve our testing situation. These patches have all been tried to ensure they work as intended, but if you notice any issues please report them!
We encourage all users to test this new version and then upgrade. Thanks to all who get involved!

Description
Link
Improvement
Reduce number of context switches on the hot path inside AwaitingLeadershipProxy when checking for leadership.
Feature
Added a new paxos runtime configuration enable-batching-for-single-leader to timelock runtime configuration. If set to true, timelock internal communication will use the batched endpoints in a single leader mode. This feature is experimental, contact the altasdb team if you wish to enable it.
Improvement
Added further protections around thread explosion when a non-leader node goes down. Previously this was limited at 100 * num_clients: we now will not spin up more than 100 threads per remote across clients when talking to a remote acceptor."

cosmos/cosmos-sdk,"This release includes an important x/capabiliy module bug fix for 0.42.7 and 0.42.8 which prohibits IBC to create new channels (issuse).
The fix changes the x/capability/keeper/Keeper.InitializeAndSeal method behavior and requires to update an app module manager by adding x/capability module to Begin Blockers.
We also fixed <app> init --recovery mode where the mnemonic was not handled correctly.
We also changed <app> tx distribution withdraw-all-rewards CLI by forcing the broadcast mode if a chunk size is greater than 0. This will ensure that the transactions do not fail even if the user uses invalid broadcast modes for this command (sync and async). This was requested by the community and we consider it as fixing the withdraw-all-rewards behavior.
See the Cosmos SDK v0.42.9 milestone on our issue tracker for the exhaustive list of all changes."

vyxal/vyxal,"The great bug fix has somewhat come to a halt, as what remains is mostly typing ambiguities we're unsure how to handle. Also, the online interpreter has been substantially upgraded, now supporting several new functionalities.
Changes
kP (printable ASCII) is now in order, and kQ is printable ASCII with a space thanks to @tobyck
Vyxal's infinite list support has greatly improved - the interpreter can now tell the difference between infinite and finite lists, opening the door to a lot of possibilities. Thanks to @Steffan153  for this!

⁺, which decodes the next character as a number, now works with all chars [thanks to (https://github.com//pull/1275) @Steffan153]
∆F, 1-indexed fibonacci, now vectorizes properly thanks to @Steffan153
Online interpreter
The online interpreter now has a better search function. It now uses fuzzy pattern matching and sorts by closeness. Thanks to @cjquines for this!
The keyboard tooltips now have buttons you can click to insert digraphs, thanks to @Steffan153
The search function now highlights search results thanks to @cjquines
You can now use tab completions for unicode chars on the online interpreter, where pairs of characters will get resolved to single characters by pressing tab. For example, .o becomes ȯ, bp becomes Þ. Thanks to @Steffan153 for this!

Support Kubernetes 1.6 - a new DaemonSet is required (see below for upgrading)
Support Kubernetes 1.6 by allowing CNI callers to send a  network-delete request for a container that is not running or has never been attached to the network
Leave non-weave ipsets alone in Network Policy Controller (e.g. when running Weave Net alonside keepalived-vip)
Fix various small issues revealed by 'staticcheck' tool
Avoid leaving 'defunct' processes when weave-kube container restarts
When using the CNI plugin with a non-standard network configuration file, the weave bridge could get the same IP as a container, if 'weave expose' hadn't run at that point
Build and Testing
Check that no defunct processes remain after each test
Update build and test scripts to work with Kubernetes 1.6 beta
Installation and Upgrading of Weave Net
Follow the installation instructions to install this latest release of weave.
When upgrading from a version earlier than 1.9.0, if your host's network interface has a limit on packet size (the ""MTU"") smaller than 1496 bytes, you should reboot after upgrading to ensure encrypted fast datapath can work. For instance this applies to Google Cloud Platform, but is not necessary on AWS.
Weave Net 1.9.4 is fully compatible with all previous versions back to 1.1.0, so it is possible to upgrade clusters incrementally and run mixed versions.
Upgrading Kubernetes to version 1.6
Note a bug in Kubernetes 1.6 () means that Weave Net will not pick up existing pod IP addresses on a restart.  Until this is fixed we recommend you reboot instead of individually deleting the Weave Net pod.
In version 1.6, Kubernetes has increased security, so we need to create a special service account to run Weave Net.  This is done in the file weave-daemonset-k8s-1.6.yaml attached to the release.
Also, the toleration required to let Weave Net run on master nodes has moved from an annotation to a field on the DaemonSet spec object.
The command to apply this new configuration via short URL is:
kubectl apply -f https://git.io/weave-kube-1.6
If you have edited the Weave Net DaemonSet from a previous release, you will need to re-make your changes against the new version.
Upgrading the Weave Net Kubernetes addon (weave-kube)
Kubernetes does not currently support rolling upgrades of daemon sets, so you will need to perform the procedure manually - see https://weave.works/docs/net/latest/kube-addon/ for details.

apache/incubator-datasketches-java,"New HLL-based UniqueCountMap sketch
This is a totally new sketch in the HLL package that addresses real-time unique counting of identifiers associated with millions of Keys.  Please refer to the javadocs for the UniqueCountMap sketch class in the sketches/hll package.
Fixed SerDe Compatibility With Shaded, Reallocated sketches-core.jar for Pig and Hive
The previous scheme of creating a hash ID from the SerDe class names to prevent accidental deserialization with the wrong SerDe class was fragile and failed when the core classes were shaded and reallocated for the Pig and Hive jars.  In our attempt to protect the user from themselves, we had inadvertently created a worse problem.
This has now been fixed, but to do that we had to abandon the SerDe ID concept entirely.  This fix is now backward compatible will all earlier releases of SerDe classes.
Upgraded Reservoir Sampling to allow for full integer precision values of K.
This allows the sketch size specification, K, for the Reservoir sketches to have full integer precision.  This is also backward compatible with the earlier specification."

canalplus/rx-player,"Release 2.1.2 (2017-06-14)
Overview
This release brings multiple bug fixes. The most notable bug it fixes led to the impossibility to play DRM-protected contents, following a (poorly-managed) RxJS version update.
To sum up this version:
DRM-protected contents are now perfectly playable
the ""new"" seekTo API (used with an object instead of a number) had some typos which led to weird behaviors. This has been fixed.
the lowest video bitrate is now considered when the width of the video element is not sufficient
Some internal error management has been fixed
Bug fixes
stream: the BUFFER_APPEND_ERROR error, happening when a SourceBuffer.appendBuffer failed for an unknown reason, is now a fatal error for audio/video segments
eme: fix rxjs timeout management which prevented from playing DRM-protected contents
api: add securities to avoid useless errors to be thrown when the player already encounters an error
position: fix a bug which prevented to seek at the beginning of the content with the new api
position: fix typo which prevented to perform absolute seeks with the new api
buffer: automatically seek if there is a discontinuity in a live stream
adaptive: take the lowest bitrate (instead of the initial/default one) when the player is not displayed/too small"

evanw/esbuild,"Avoid a syntax error in the presence of direct eval ()
The behavior of nested function declarations in JavaScript depends on whether the code is run in strict mode or not. It would be problematic if esbuild preserved nested function declarations in its output because then the behavior would depend on whether the output was run in strict mode or not instead of respecting the strict mode behavior of the original source code. To avoid this, esbuild transforms nested function declarations to preserve the intended behavior of the original source code regardless of whether the output is run in strict mode or not:
// Original code
if (true) {
function foo() {}
console.log(!!foo)
foo = null
console.log(!!foo)
console.log(!!foo)
// Transformed code
if (true) {
let foo2 = function() {
var foo = foo2;
console.log(!!foo2);
foo2 = null;
console.log(!!foo2);
console.log(!!foo);
In the above example, the original code should print true false true because it's not run in strict mode (it doesn't contain ""use strict"" and is not an ES module). The code that esbuild generates has been transformed such that it prints true false true regardless of whether it's run in strict mode or not.
However, this transformation is impossible if the code contains direct eval because direct eval ""poisons"" all containing scopes by preventing anything in those scopes from being renamed. That prevents esbuild from splitting up accesses to foo into two separate variables with different names. Previously esbuild still did this transformation but with two variables both named foo, which is a syntax error. With this release esbuild will now skip doing this transformation when direct eval is present to avoid generating code with a syntax error. This means that the generated code may no longer behave as intended since the behavior depends on the run-time strict mode setting instead of the strict mode setting present in the original source code. To fix this problem, you will need to remove the use of direct eval.
Fix a bundling scenario involving multiple symlinks ()
This release contains a fix for a bundling scenario involving an import path where multiple path segments are symlinks. Previously esbuild was unable to resolve certain import paths in this scenario, but these import paths should now work starting with this release. This fix was contributed by @onebytegone."

hvac/hvac,"BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY NOTICE:
With the newly added hvac.adapters.Request class, request kwargs can no longer be directly modified via the _kwargs attribute on the Client class. If runtime modifications to this dictionary are required, callers either need to explicitly pass in a new adapter instance with the desired settings via the adapter propery on the Client class or access the _kwargs property via the adapter property on the Client class.
See the Advanced Usage section of this module's documentation for additional details.
IMPROVEMENTS:
sphinx documentation and readthedocs.io project added. GH-222
README.md included in setuptools metadata. GH-222
All tune_secret_backend() parameters now accepted. GH-215

trivago/gollum,"Release notes
This is a patch / minor features release.
New features in this release include improved JSON processing and AWS Kinesis support.
There are a lot of critical bugfixes in the Kafka and spooling pipelines.
If you are running on v0.4.1 and are using these an update is strongly recommended.
Fixed
consumer.SysLogD now has more meaningful errormessages
consumer.File now properly supports file rotation if the file to read is a symlink
Scribe and Kafka metrics are now only updated upon successful send
Fixed an out of bounds panic when producer.File was rotating logfiles without an extension
Compression of files after rotation by produer.File now works (again)
producer.Kafka now only reconnects if all topics report an error
producer.Spool now properly respools long messages
producer.Spool will not delete a file if a message in it could not be processed
producer.Spool will try to automatically respool files after a restart
producer.Spool will rotate non-empty files even if no new messages come in
producer.Spool will recreate folders when removed during runtime
producer.Spool will drop messages if rotation failes (not reroute)
Messages that are spooled twice now retain their original stream
Better handling of situations where Sarama (Kafka) writes become blocking
Plugins now start up as ""initializing"" not as ""dead"" preventing dropped messages during startup
New
New formatter format.SplitToJSON to convert CSV data to JSON
New formatter format.ProcessJSON to modify JSON data
producer.File can now set permissions for any folders created
RPM spec file added
producer.File can now add zero padding to rotated file numbering
producer.File can now prune logfiles by file age
producer.Spool can now be rate limited
Dev version (major.minor.patch.dev) is now part of the metrics
New AWS Kinesis producer and consumer
Getting started
Building instruction can be found in the readme.
Documentation is available at read the docs and godoc."
heroiclabs/nakama,"Notable changes
Added
More flexible query-based filter when listing realtime multiplayer matches.
Runtime function to batch get groups by group ID.
Allow authoritative match join attempts to carry metadata from the client.
Changed
Improved cancellation of ongoing work when clients disconnect.
Improved validation of dispatcher broadcast message filters.
Set maximum size of authoritative match labels to 2048 bytes.
Fixed
Use leaderboard expires rather than end active IDs with leaderboard resets.
Better validation of tournament duration when a reset schedule is set.
Set default matchmaker input query if none supplied with the request.
Removed a possible race condition when session ping backoff triggers concurrently with a timed ping.
Errors returned by InitModule hooks from Go runtime plugins will now correctly halt startup."
ghiscoding/angular-slickgrid,"This release is not a huge release but it has certain features and fixes worth knowing about.
Small chore update was to just upgrade the lib project to Angular 8 (from 7) and also ng-packagr which is used to create the lib itself. You might be wondering, why not upgrade the lib to Angular 10 internally? Mainly to be a bit more on the cautious side, because Angular 9+ has the new Ivy rendering engine, so better play safe and stick with something that I know still works and is backward-compatible. This version should have no impact but just in case I decided to release it under a minor version.
There's also a new warning message (inside the grid) that will show ""No Data to Display."" that can shown after filtering or when it's simply empty. As all the other feature I have done, there are few options with it (see the emptyWarning interface for options), you can also disable it with the flag enableEmptyDataWarningMessage.
Another main topic that was brought up, and much time was spent on, was what we thought to be memory and/or detached DOM nodes but even if we fixed a few unsubscribed events (in both the core and this lib), the main problem ended up (and still is) coming from the Flatpickr lib (date picker) which was leaking detached elements (that was patch in the lib) and also an event listener causing performance downgrade which is caused by Flatpickr listening to the keydown event on the document.body and I have opened a PR to fix that, so hopefully this will be merged eventually (you could maybe upvote the PR to show interest in getting that merged).
Small Possible Breaking change
If you get an error with JQuery.Event it's because I now use the correct jQuery Event Type, you simply need to install it via yarn --dev @types/jquery (or use the NPM command to install as Dev Dependency) to get rid of the build error.
Lastly...

New Minor Features
virtualDomBuffer option now available to give manual control over virtual DOM buffer
the resizableColumns now accepts the additional values of header and cell to give more choice on where the column resize handles are added
textarea formatters now automatically resize row height when column is resized. To enable this behaviour on non textarea formatted columns set the variableHieght property to true on that column
new download column definition property to prevent column being included in download. set to false to remove column in download data
new cell component shortcut functions added: getData, getField
added select functions to the row component: select, deselect, toggleSelect
added getRows function to return all row components in the table
fallback mode added to detect when edge and ie are being used and scale back some of the table functions to ensure a smooth user experience.
Bug Fixes

ledgerhq/ledgerjs,"hw-app-btc: onDeviceStreaming
Introduce a new callback to be notified on progress events of APDUs streaming, typically for each input of a transaction.
onDeviceStreaming, if provided, will be called with an object { index, total, progress }. Progress will varies from 0.0 to 1.0 (included). index will vary from 0 to total (included).
onDeviceStreaming is not called at all if there is not more than X inputs. (today X = 3). In other words, it's only called when there is a significant waiting time to expect.
A typically integration you can do is:
initially display a spinner/loading state to the user
hook to onDeviceStreaming to display user some progress (e.progress*100).toFixed(0)+""%""
hook to onDeviceSignatureRequested to know when you need to ask user to confirm on device
hook to onDeviceSignatureGranted to know when user have confirmed on the device (and resume to a spinner)"

Bleeding edge
PHPStan runs in multiple threads! This leads to huge performance gain roughly equivalent to the number of your CPU cores! This works on all operating systems and does not require any special PHP extension.
If you want to see the shape of things to come and adopt bleeding edge features early, you can include this config file in your project's phpstan.neon:
includes:
- vendor/phpstan/phpstan/conf/bleedingEdge.neon
Of course, there are no backwards compatibility guarantees when you include this file. The behaviour and reported errors can change in minor versions with this file included.

The Burnt Bernoulli release has a few fixes, though is mostly maintenance work under the hood.
Cut/Copy/Paste cells now operate on the focused cell
Pinned cell is gone (see)
We'd love to support this kind of feature with some rethinking on how it's implemented. More than once it's been a stumbling block to maintaining the overall app.
Under the covers
We've switched over to a byRef structure for contents and kernels within the redux store. As a precursor to directory navigation and kernel switching in the jupyter extension, this brings us a clean setup for remote resources that may not have been loaded yet (or are in various states). Classically, users think there is one kernel running at a time. When you switch kernels (or start a new kernel), you effectively have two running -- the one being shutdown and the one starting up. The overall state structure is documented in plan.md and looks roughly like this
entities:
currentNotebookRef: <contentRef>
kernels:
byRef:
[kernelRef]: { // doesn't matter if this is a local or remote kernel
channels: ...
contents:
byRef:
[contentRef]: {
filepath: somewhere
model: actualNotebookDocument

open-policy-agent/opa,"This release migrates the OPA documentation over to Hugo (from
GitBook). Going forward the OPA documentation will be generated using
Hugo and hosted on Netlify (instead of GitHub Pages). The Hugo/Netlify
stack brings us inline with the goal for other CNCF projects and
provides nice features like ""preview before merge"".
This release includes a small but backwards incompatible change to the
http.send built-in. Previously, http.send would always decode
responses as JSON even if the Content-Type was unset or explicitly not
JSON. If you were previously relying on HTTP responses that did not
set the Content-Type correctly, you will need to update your policy to
pass ""force_json_decode"": true as in the http.send parameters.
Fixes
Fix panic in mod operation ()
Fix eval tree enumeration to return errors ()
Fix http.send to handle non-JSON responses ()
Fix backticks in SSH example that were causing problems ()
Fix IAM examples to use regex instead of glob syntax ()
Miscellaneous
Add support to register custom stages in the compiler
Add rootless Docker image stream
Improve hash distribution on objects

Additions and Improvements
Improve Execution Layer error logging
Add new validator client metric validator_remote_beacon_nodes_requests_total which tracks the requests made to remote beacon nodes (useful when there are failovers configured)
The voluntary-exit subcommand can restrict the exit to a specific list of validators public keys using the option --validator-public-keys.
Example: teku voluntary-exit --beacon-node-api-endpoint=<ENDPOINT>[,<ENDPOINT>...]... --data-validator-path=<PATH> --include-keymanager-keys=<BOOLEAN> --validator-keys=<KEY_DIR>:<PASS_DIR> | <KEY_FILE>:<PASS_FILE> --validator-public-keys=<PUBKEY>[,<PUBKEY>...]...
To include validator keys managed via keymanager APIs, the option --include-keymanager-keys could be set to true (The default value is set to false)
Throttle signing of validator registrations when using an external signer
Bug Fixes
Filter out unknown validators when sending validator registrations to the builder network
Fix issue which could cause locally produced aggregates to not be gossiped
Fix issue where the sync module could cause Unexpected rejected execution due to full task queue in nioEventLoopGroup log messages and high CPU usage
Upcoming Breaking Changes
The validator_beacon_node_published_attestation_total, validator_beacon_node_published_aggregate_total,
and validator_beacon_node_published_block_total metrics have been deprecated in favour of the new validator_beacon_node_requests_total metric.
The old metrics will be removed in a future release. An update to the Teku Dashboard that uses the new metric is available.
The /eth/v1/debug/beacon/states/:state_id endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the v2 Altair endpoint /eth/v2/debug/beacon/states/:state_id
The /eth/v1/beacon/blocks/:block_id endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the v2 Altair endpoint /eth/v2/beacon/blocks/:block_id
The /eth/v1/validator/blocks/:slot endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the v2 Altair endpoint /eth/v2/validator/blocks/:slot
The /eth/v1/debug/beacon/heads endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the v2 Bellatrix endpoint /eth/v2/debug/beacon/heads
The commandline option --network of the validator-client subcommand has been undeprecated and can be used to select a network for standalone validator clients. When set to auto, it automatically
fetches network configuration information from the configured beacon node endpoint."

gravitational/teleport,"Description
Resolved sporadic errors caused by requests fail to comply with Kubernetes API spec by not specifying resource identifiers.
Fixed a bug when using automatic updates and the discovery service. The default install script now installs the correct Teleport version by querying the version server.
Teleport Proxy Service now runs a version server by default serving its own version.
Fixed a regression where tsh kube credentials fails to re-login when credentials expire.
TBot now supports --proxy-server for explicitly configuring the Proxy address. We recommend switching to this if you currently specify the address of your Teleport proxy to --auth-server.
Expanded the EC2 joining process to include newly created AWS regions.
Added GCP MySQL access IAM Authentication support.
Fixed an issue in SAML IdP entity descriptor generator process, which would fail to generate entity descriptor if the configured Entity ID endpoint would return HTTP status code above 200 and below 400.
Updated Go to 1.21.8.
Updated electron-builder dependency to address possible arbitrary code execution in the Windows installer of Teleport Connect (CVE-2024-27303).
Improved reliability and performance of tbot.
Filtered terminated sessions from the tsh sessions ls output.
Prevented panic when AccessList's status field is not set.
Fixed an issue with over counting of reported Teleport updater metrics.
Fixed a bug that caused tsh to return ""private key policy not met"" errors instead of automatically initiating re-login to satisfy the private key policy.
Fixed application access events being overwritten when using DynamoDB as event storage.
Fixed issue where DynamoDB writes could fail when recording too many records.
Added a tbot-only tbot-distroless container image, bringing an 80% size reduction over the Teleport teleport image.

cakephp/cakephp,"The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP 4.0.10. This release contains security fixes and is a recommended upgrade for all applications still using 4.0.x.
The security fixes address a vulnerability in the CsrfProtectionMiddleware that allowed method override parameters to bypass CSRF checks for requests with no additional POST data. The fixes validate that the HTTP method override is a valid HTTP method name. We'd like to thank Xhelal Likaj for reporting this issue to us via our security mailing list.
The versions impacted by this issue are >4.0.0, <=4.0.9 and >4.1.0, <=4.1.3. Releases after 4.1.3 are not vulnerable as they already validated the HTTP method names.
Bugfixes
You can expect the following changes in 4.0.10. See the changelog for every commit.

elasticsearch-dump/elasticsearch-dump,"Adds the ability to use a Javascript module for the transform. When specifying the transform option, prefix the value with @ (a curl convention) to load the top-level function which is called with the document and the parsed arguments to the module.
Uses a pseudo-URL format to specify arguments to the module as follows:
elasticdump --transform='@./transforms/my-transform?param1=value&param2=another-value'
With a module at ./transforms/my-transform.js with the following:
module.exports = function (doc, options) {
// do something to doc
will load module ./transforms/my-transform.js', and execute the function with docandoptions={""param1"": ""value"", ""param2"": ""another-value""}`.
Also supplied is an example transform for anonymizing data on-the-fly. It works well for our needs, and may suit yours too.
Regular scripts passed as strings to elasticdump are still parsed and used the same as before. This changes nothing about existing behaviour, only adds to it. Notably, this bypasses the security of the sandboxed vm environment used by the string-based transform, giving you more flexibility."

vaadin/flow,"Vaadin Flow 1.0.14 is a maintenance version with the following notable changes:
Fixes:
Use time-constant comparison for security tokens. PR:9896 Thanks to Xhelal Likaj for reporting this
This is the same as, but also applied for the upload security key and the push id since both of those are also used to protect against cross-site attacks. In addition, documentation for the push id is clarified to point out its role.
Use time-constant comparison for CSRF tokens. PR:9875 Thanks to Xhelal Likaj for reporting this
This hardens the framework against a theoretical timing attack based on comparing how quickly a request with an invalid CSRF token is rejected.
For all changes, see changes since 1.0.13
For what is new in 1.0, see 1.0.0 release notes"
sfdo-tooling/cumulusci,"Breaking changes:
The retries, retry_interval, and retry_interval_add options have been removed from the run_tests task. These were misleading as they did not actually retry failing tests.
New features:
The run_tests task now supports a retry_failures parameter. This is a list of regular expressions to match against each unit test failure's message and stack trace; if all failing tests match, the failing tests will be retried serially. Set retry_always to True to trigger this behavior when any failure matches.
There is now a default CumulusCI global connected app that can be used to connect to persistent orgs (assuming you know the credentials) without creating a new connected app. It's still possible to configure a custom connected app using cci service connect connected_app if more control over the connected app settings is needed.
When CumulusCI is being run in a non-interactive context it can now obtain an access token for a persistent org using a JWT instead of a refresh token. This approach is used if the SFDX_CLIENT_ID and SFDX_HUB_KEY environment variables are set. This makes it easier to manage persistent org connections in the context of a hosted service because it's possible to replace the connected app's certificate without needing to obtain new refresh tokens for each org.
Issues closed:
Fixed a bug where showing the summary of flow steps would break with sub-steps in MetaDeploy.
Fixed a bug in the caching of preflight task results in MetaDeploy."

jitsucom/jitsu,"This hotfix release includes the following changes:
Experimental Sources transformation
Added experimental JavaScript transformation for Sources data. Can be enabled with experimental.source_transform_enabled: true yaml property or EXPERIMENTAL_SOURCE_TRANSFORM_ENABLED=true environment variable.
If one destination ingests data from multiple Sources and API-Keys, the same JavaScript code will be applied to all kinds of data.
In this case it may be required to distinguish what source each particular object is coming from by properties of that object.
For that purpose _source_id property was added for all data ingested from sources
Other changes
Don't treat cases when API-Key has no linked destinations yet as errors."

Fix numeric widget console warnings regarding flex styling refs @ichim-david

Internal
Fix some key points to improve the circular imports problem @sneridagh
App and View components are meant to be used only by Volto internals, so it's no
point into having them exported in components/index.js that facilitated a path for
circular imports.
withObjectBrowser and friends also are prone to facilitate a path for having
circular imports, so we are using there only absolute imports.
All these changes are non-breaking and non-intrusive."

centrifugal/centrifugo,"Centrifugo is an open-source scalable real-time messaging server. Centrifugo can instantly deliver messages to application online users connected over supported transports (WebSocket, HTTP-streaming, SSE/EventSource, GRPC, SockJS, WebTransport). Centrifugo has the concept of a channel – so it's a user-facing PUB/SUB server.
Centrifugo is language-agnostic and can be used to build chat apps, live comments, multiplayer games, real-time data visualizations, collaborative tools, etc. in combination with any backend. It is well suited for modern architectures and allows decoupling the business logic from the real-time transport layer.
Several official client SDKs for browser and mobile development wrap the bidirectional protocol. In addition, Centrifugo supports a unidirectional approach for simple use cases with no SDK dependency.
For details, go to the Centrifugo documentation site.

EntityDatabase.__delitem__ wasn't working.
.send_message() was failing with channels.

Larger chunk when downloading files should result in faster downloads.
You can use a callable key for the EntityDatabase, so it can be any filter you need.
Internal changes:
MsgsAck is now sent in a container rather than its own request.
.get_input_photo is now used in the generated code.
.process_entities was being called from more places than only __call__.
MtProtoSender now relies more on the generated code to read responses."

dagster-io/dagster,"New
When user code raises an error inside handle_output, load_input, or a type check function, the log output now includes context about which input or output the error occurred during.
Added a secondary index to improve performance when querying run status. Run dagster instance migrate to upgrade.
[Helm] Celery queues can now be configured with different node selectors. Previously, configuring a node selector applied it to all Celery queues.
In Dagit, a repository location reload button is now available in the header of every pipeline, schedule, and sensor page.
When viewing a run in Dagit, log filtering behavior has been improved. step and type filtering now offer fuzzy search, all log event types are now searchable, and visual bugs within the input have been repaired. Additionally, the default setting for “Hide non-matches” has been flipped to true.
After launching a backfill in Dagit, the success message now includes a link to view the runs for the backfill.
The dagster-daemon process now runs faster when running multiple schedulers or sensors from the same repository.
When launching a backfill from Dagit, the “Re-execute From Last Run” option has been removed, because it had confusing semantics.  “Re-execute From Failure” now includes a tooltip.
fs_io_manager now defaults the base directory to base_dir via the Dagster instance’s local_artifact_storage configuration. Previously, it defaults to the directory where the pipeline is executed.
Experimental IO managers versioned_filesystem_io_manager and custom_path_fs_io_manager now require base_dir as part of the resource configs. Previously, the base_dir defaulted to the directory where the pipeline was executed.
Added a backfill daemon that submits backfill runs in a daemon process.  This should relieve memory / CPU requirements for scheduling large backfill jobs.  Enabling this feature requires a schema migration to the runs storage via the CLI command dagster instance migrate and configuring your instance with the following settings in dagster.yaml:
backfill:
daemon_enabled: true
There is a corresponding flag in the Dagster helm chart to enable this instance configuration.  See the Helm chart’s values.yaml file for more information.
Both sensors and schedule definitions support a description parameter that takes in a human-readable string description and displays it on the corresponding landing page in Dagit.
Integrations
[dagster-gcp] The gcs_pickle_io_manager now also retries on 403 Forbidden errors, which previously would only retry on 429 TooManyRequests.
Bug Fixes
The use of Tuple with nested inner types in solid definitions no longer causes GraphQL errors
When searching assets in Dagit, keyboard navigation to the highlighted suggestion now navigates to the correct asset.
In some cases, run status strings in Dagit (e.g. “Queued”, “Running”, “Failed”) did not accurately match the status of the run. This has been repaired.
The experimental CLI command dagster new-repo should now properly generate subdirectories and files, without needing to install dagster from source (e.g. with pip install --editable).
Sensor minimum intervals now interact in a more compatible way with sensor daemon intervals to minimize evaluation ticks getting skipped.  This should result in the cadence of sensor evaluations being less choppy.
Dependencies
Removed Dagster’s pin of the pendulum datetime/timezone library.

httpie/httpie,"Fixed CVE-2019-10751 — the way the output filename is generated for --download requests without --output resulting in a redirect has been changed to only consider the initial URL as the base for the generated filename, and not the final one. This fixes a potential security issue under the following scenario:
A --download request with no explicit --output is made (e.g., $ http -d  example.org/file.txt), instructing HTTPie to generate the output filename from the Content-Disposition response header, or from the URL if the header is not provided.
The server handling the request has been modified by an attacker and instead of the expected response the URL returns a redirect to another URL, e.g., attacker.example.org/.bash_profile, whose response does not provide  a Content-Disposition header (i.e., the base for the  generated filename becomes .bash_profile instead of file.txt).
Your current directory doesn’t already contain .bash_profile (i.e., no unique suffix is added to the generated filename).
You don’t notice the potentially unexpected output filename as reported by HTTPie in the console output (e.g., Downloading 100.00 B to "".bash_profile"")."

shim: Removed code that blocked processor weight/maximum to be set for processor QoS for process-isolated Windows containers. Previously there was an OS issue preventing this from working, but that has been fixed.

apollographql/apollo-android,"Version 2.5.3 is a maintenance release with improvements around codegen, runtime and cache.
Interfaces on interfaces
Version 2.5.3 adds support for GraphQL RFC 373 (interfaces implementing interfaces). This makes sure the codegen understands interfaces implementing other interfaces and can compute the fragments possible types appropriately. It doesn't change the generated code.
Json Content-Type
Version 2.5.3 changes the Content-Type for apollo-runtime-kotlin from ""aplication/json; charset=utf-8"" to ""application/json"". This has been confusing spring servers and is the default json content type moving forward. If everything goes well, apollo-runtime will also switch to ""application/json"" in a future release. Read more in. Many thanks to @vikrama for diving into this and fixing it.
Full Changelog
New
[Runtime] Added toString methods to api.Error and api.Error.Location ()
[Codegen] Support interface on interface ()
‍ Fixes
[Normalized Cache] Be more robust to publish errors ()
[Multiplatform] Removing deprecated charset=utf-8 from Content-Type header for multiplatform ()

vuetifyjs/vuetify,"Things we are deprecating
c81496e The router prop for all components implementing route-link mixin (v-list-tile, v-btn, etc) will no longer be needed in 0.14. As such, we are deprecating it now with a warning message to inform you of the upcoming change. Your application will still work as normal
Things we (potentially) broke
This was not meant to be a breaking change, but does reflect a mistake on the dev team's part for consistency when using custom transitions on components through the provided transition prop. Before, it used the tag provided and generated an element. Now, it will instead properly use the prop for designating the transition name. Only affects v-menu and v-dialog
Fixed a bug where v-menu and v-dialog where using transition for the actual component as opposed to the name
Things we added
Added new design for 24hr v-time-picker
Added back explicit props for toolbar and footer on v-app. The logic that was used to do this automatically stopped working and was causing the main v-container to not size properly. If this was the case in your application, simply use the props that apply to your application and it should work now
Added the ability to pass HTML to all form components that support hint
Things we fixed
Fixed regression of prepended-icon styles on v-text-field
Fixed tabindex being applied to v-select autocomplete prop search field, requiring pressing tab twice to move to the next input
Fixed a bug where placing a badge on a v-btn would be cut off due to a deprecated overflow still being on the content element
Fixed a bug where v-time-picker would not automatically transition to the minutes when selecting an hour on mobile displays
Fixed a bug where v-select label with prop single-line was displaying when the field was dirty
Fixed a bug with no results with searching in v-data-table
Fixed a bug where v-bottom-navigation was not rendering properly on mobile (also cleaned it up a bit, should work flawless on IE11 now)
Fixed the margin on v-btn with the block prop causing it to be improperly aligned
Fixed a bug where a v-dialog rendered the activator slot when no activator was applied
Fixed select-all prop in v-data-table throwing error
Fixed a bug where applying the v-tooltip directive to v-btn with the fab prop caused the button to not be positioned correctly
Fixed bug where a numeric 0 with the min prop in v-text-field was not being properly evaluated
Fixed v-text-field with the suffix prop being the incorrect font-size
Add back accidentally removed row/column specific breakpoints on v-layout
Fixed a bug where in certain conditions the v-dialog would create two overlays if the value prop was set to true at run time
Fixed a bug where the v-text-field count prop did not work properly on IE11
Fixed a bug where a v-chip with the closable prop inside of a v-dialog would close the dialog when clicked
Fixed a bug where v-stepper would not use the application's primary color for the steps on Safari
Things you fixed
Updated v-toolbar to only apply z-index when using the fixed prop, this should resolve toolbars in the content flow from appearing above the primary fixed one. (thanks @jrast)
Fixed a bug where the no-data-text generated tile when search results using autocomplete prop on the v-select was clickable (thanks @qw3n)
Updated v-data-table tbody styles to properly comply with MD Spec (thanks @arvanoid)"

You can find previous versions compiled with PyTorch 1.3 & 1.4 here. The compatibility is still ensured in our CI, but we will discard the support of PyTorch 1.3 & 1.4 next year.

Get type-checked input from humans in the loop
Human-in-the-loop flows just got an upgrade. You can now pause or suspend a flow and wait for type-checked input. To get started, declare the structure of the input data using a Pydantic model, and Prefect will render a form dynamically in the UI when a human resumes the flow. Form validation will ensure that the data conforms to your Pydantic model, and your flow will receive tbe input.
Prefect's new RunInput class powers this experience. RunInput is a subclass of Pydantic's BaseModel. Here's an example of a RunInput that uses dates, literals, and nested Pydantic models to show you what's possible:
class Person(RunInput):
first_name: str
last_name: str
birthday: datetime.date
likes_tofu: bool
age: int = Field(gt=0, lt=150)
shirt_size: Literal[ShirtSize.SMALL, ShirtSize.MEDIUM, ShirtSize.LARGE,
ShirtSize.XLARGE]
shirt_color: Literal[""red"", ""blue"", ""green""]
preferred_delivery_time: datetime.datetime
shipping_address: ShippingAddress
billing_address: BillingAddress | SameAsShipping = Field(
title="""", default_factory=SameAsShipping
Check out our guide on how to create human-in-the-loop flows to learn more!

reduxjs/redux-toolkit,"This bugfix release rewrites the RTKQ hook TS types to significantly improve TS perf.
Changelog
RTKQ TS Perf
A number of users had reported that Intellisense for RTKQ API objects was extremely slow (multiple seconds) - see discussion in .  We did some perf investigation on user-provided examples, and concluded that the biggest factor to slow RTKQ TS perf was the calculation of hook names like useGetPokemonQuery, which was generating a large TS union of types.
We've rewritten that hook names type calculation to use mapped types and a couple of intersections.  In a specific user-provided stress test repo, it dropped TS calculation time by 60% (2600ms to 1000ms).
There's more potential work we can do to improve things, but this seems like a major perf improvement worth shipping now.

Verifying the release
Note: the public key 1AA6 2C17 C56D 4275 A541 2320 9CD5 646C 0AD5 161E used to sign previous releases was revoked and replaced with the key DD09 E413 0975 0EBF AE0D EF63 5092 49B0 68D2 15AE for operational reasons. The new key is now hosted on the shiftcrypto.ch webserver.
Get a public key of security@shiftcrypto.ch with fingerprint DD09 E413 0975 0EBF AE0D EF63 5092 49B0 68D2 15AE:
curl https://shiftcrypto.ch/download/shiftcryptosec-509249B068D215AE.gpg.asc | gpg --import
Download the app for your platform and the corresponding .asc file and place them in the same folder.
We will verify the signature of the macOS release as an example. The other files are verified in the same way by replacing the filename.
To verify the signature, execute:
gpg --verify BitBox-4.35.1-macOS.zip.asc
You should see the following output:
gpg --verify BitBox-4.35.1-macOS.zip.asc
gpg: assuming signed data in 'BitBox-4.35.1-macOS.zip'
gpg: Signature made <DATE AND TIME>
gpg: Good signature from ""ShiftCrypto Security <security@shiftcrypto.ch>"" [ultimate]
(The [ultimate] could say [unknown] or something else depending on your trust level.)"
