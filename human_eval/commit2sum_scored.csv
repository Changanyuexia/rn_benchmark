Summary
Bugfix - Update the admin user role assignment to enforce the config:
Bugfix - Crash when processing crafted TIFF files:
Bugfix - Update reva to v2.19.5:
Bugfix - Fix infected file handling:
Details
Bugfix - Update the admin user role assignment to enforce the config:
The admin user role assigment was not updated after the first assignment. We now
read the assigned role during init and update the admin user ID accordingly if
the role is not assigned. This is especially needed when the OCIS_ADMIN_USER_ID
is set after the autoprovisioning of the admin user when it originates from an
external Identity Provider.
Bugfix - Crash when processing crafted TIFF files:
Fix for a vulnerability with low severity in disintegration/imaging.

Bugfix - Update reva to v2.19.5:
We updated reva to v2.19.5
Bugfix      cs3org/reva: Write blob based on session id
