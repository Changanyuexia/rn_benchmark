This security release addresses the following issues
CVE-2023-41327 - Controlled SSRF through URL in the WireMock Webhooks Extension and WireMock Studio
Base CVSS Score: 4.6 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L/E:F/RL:O/RC:C)
CVE-2023-41329 - Domain restrictions bypass via DNS Rebinding in WireMock and WireMock Studio webhooks, proxy and recorder modes
Base CVSS Score: 3.9 (AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L/E:F/RL:O/RC:C)
NOTE: WireMock Studio, a proprietary distribution discontinued in 2022, is also affected by those issues and also affected by CVE-2023-39967 - Overall CVSS Score 8.6 - “Controlled and full-read SSRF through URL parameter when testing a request, webhooks and proxy mode”. The fixes will not be provided. The vendor recommends migrating to WireMock Cloud which is available as SaaS and private beta for on-premises deployments

NOTE: Other distributions like Testcontainers modules or Helm chart need explicit version declaration, and hence a user action is needed to update the dependencies should they be considered a risk

Support for Python 3.7 has been dropped, in accordance with JAX's
{ref}version-support-policy.
The behavior of XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=.XX has been changed to allocate XX% of
the total GPU memory instead of the previous behavior of using currently available GPU memory
to calculate preallocation. Please refer to
GPU memory allocation for
more details.
The deprecated method .block_host_until_ready() has been removed. Use
