Changelog
Adds permalink: false option to bypass writing a template to the output directory. Set this in front matter, template or directory data files, or even a JS data file if you want to do conditional output of templates based on Environment variables. ()
Improved error messaging, specifically with:
Errors in configuration files ()
Missing Filters in Liquid templates (), note the opt-in to a strict_filters Liquid option: https://www.11ty.io/docs/languages/liquid/#optional%3A-use-your-own-options
Improved messaging about DEBUG mode when in DEBUG mode ()
Adds Linters feature to inspect output content. ()
Behind the scenes additions to addPlugin to facilitate more configuration options for eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight v2.0 https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight/releases/tag/v2.0.0
Documentation
The .eleventyignore docs page got lost when we moved from GitHub, it now exists here: https://www.11ty.io/docs/ignores/ ()
@kleinfreund added a lovely Environment variables example to the documentation (using JS Data Files)
Docs: https://www.11ty.io/docs/data-js/#example%3A-exposing-environment-variables
Bug fixes
Fixes major issue with --passthroughall flag ()
Docs: https://www.11ty.io/docs/copy/#passthrough-all-content
Tags in template objects will always be normalized to array form, if even using a single tag string in front matter data ()
Docs: https://www.11ty.io/docs/collections/#a-single-tag%3A-cat
Fixed an issue when crossover existed between multiple passthrough copy targets () (e.g. ./css/fonts and ./css/fonts/myFont.woff2, for example)

* f85509a Support a custom tmp directory location
* 225a89b Update CHANGELOG.md","Fixed
Fixes file upload size not being properly enforced.
Fixes a bug that prevented listing a directory when it contained a named pipe. Also added a check to prevent attempting to read a named pipe directly.
Fixes a bug with the archiver logic that would include folders that had the same name prefix. (for example, requesting only map would also include map2 and map3)
Requests to the Panel that return a client error (4xx response code) no longer trigger an exponential backoff, they immediately stop the request.
Changed
CPU limit fields are only set on the Docker container if they have been specified for the server — otherwise they are left empty.
Added
Added the ability to define the location of the temporary folder used by Wings — defaults to /tmp/pterodactyl.
Adds the ability to authenticate for SFTP using public keys (requires Panel@1.8.0).

IPv6 addresses being corrupted by flawed port stripping logic for activity logs, old entries with malformed IPs will be deleted from the local SQLite database automatically
