Changelog
Fix issue with cascade of template and directory data files (template values should override directory values, the reverse was happening)
url filter now accepts falsy values (improvement over vague indexOf errors before)
Fix for issue with pagination with aliasing and permalink slug filter
Better top level error handling (get rid of UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning’s, especially with passthrough copy errors)

Bugs fixed in v0.3.6 Milestone"
"* 7d68958 Update CHANGELOG.md
* 32d6594 fix incorrect error handling logic when a JWT is created wrongly; closes pterodactyl/panel#3295
* 023d7ec Close websocket connections and allow the client to re-connect on send errors; ref pterodactyl/panel#3596
* 981756b Support escaping dollar signs in the YAML config file; closes pterodactyl/panel#3692","Fixed
Fixes improper event registration and error handling during socket authentication that would cause the incorrect error message to be returned to the client, or no error in some scenarios. Event registration is now delayed until the socket is fully authenticated to ensure needless listeners are not registed.
Fixes dollar signs always being evaluated as environment variables with no way to escape them. They can now be escaped as $$ which will transform into a single dollar sign.
Changed
A websocket connection to a server will be closed by Wings if there is a send error encountered and the client will be left to handle reconnections, rather than simply logging the error and continuing to listen for new events.

Changes
Ahead-of-time lowering and compilation functionality (tracked in
{jax-issue}) is stable and public. See the
overview and the API docs
for {mod}jax.stages.
Introduced {class}jax.Array, intended to be used for both isinstance checks
and type annotations for array types in JAX. Notice that this included some subtle
changes to how isinstance works for {class}jax.numpy.ndarray for jax-internal
objects, as {class}jax.numpy.ndarray is now a simple alias of {class}jax.Array.
Breaking changes
jax._src is no longer imported into the from the public jax namespace.
This may break users that were using JAX internals.
jax.soft_pmap has been deleted. Please use pjit or xmap instead.
jax.soft_pmap is undocumented. If it were documented, a deprecation period
would have been provided."
