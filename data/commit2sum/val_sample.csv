"Update CHANGELOG.md
parser(ini): allow setting the section name

In an egg replacer putting `[]` will cause it to not be split at the first dot.

Before this change putting `""find"": { ""/Script/Engine.GameSession.MaxPlayers"": ""<DATA>"" }`
would make the section name `/Script/Engine` and the key `GameSession.MaxPlayers`.  After
this change, the same behavior occurs, but if you wrap the key in `[]` it will set the
section name properly, for example `""find"": { ""[/Script/Engine.GameSession].MaxPlayers"": ""<DATA>"" }`
would make the sesion name `/Script/Engine.GameSession` and the key `MaxPlayers`.

server: ensure last lines are always logged","Fixed
Fixes SSL paths being improperly converted to lowercase in environments where the path is case-sensitive.
Fixes a memory leak due to the implemention of server event processing.
Changed
Selecting to redact information now redacts URLs from the log output when running the diagnostic command.
Added
Adds support for modifying the default memory overhead percentages in environments where the shipped values are not adequate.
Adds support for sending the Access-Control-Request-Private-Network header in environments where Wings will be accessed over a private network. This is defaulted to off.

"Update CHANGELOG.md
Support escaping dollar signs in the YAML config file; closes pterodactyl/panel
Close websocket connections and allow the client to re-connect on send errors; ref pterodactyl/panel
fix incorrect error handling logic when a JWT is created wrongly; closes pterodactyl/panel

Prior to this logic not only was the error response incorrect for events, but we registered event listeners before the authentication event; so if auth failed we flooded the socket with tons of output that was never going to be sent anyways.

This change now waits to register listeners until the socket is fully authenticated and we're guaranteed to have a token present.
Update CHANGELOG.md","Fixed
Fixes improper event registration and error handling during socket authentication that would cause the incorrect error message to be returned to the client, or no error in some scenarios. Event registration is now delayed until the socket is fully authenticated to ensure needless listeners are not registed.
Fixes dollar signs always being evaluated as environment variables with no way to escape them. They can now be escaped as $$ which will transform into a single dollar sign.
Changed
A websocket connection to a server will be closed by Wings if there is a send error encountered and the client will be left to handle reconnections, rather than simply logging the error and continuing to listen for new events.

Fix esn key handshake on session initialization

Before, this was based on the dsarchive/base_docker_image, which greatly
sped up building the docker image when we built all dependencies in the

We can install fewer system packages, which shrinks the size of the
docker a small amount.

We can more easily be explicit about the version of Python we want to
use.  Here it has been changed to 3.8.

easily be changed, too.

while allowing manual overrides, callbacks don't control scheduling anymore, rather we have
explicit loop scheduling.

This makes it clear that the predicate is only supposed to be used for NVidia

Generic reduce window jvp

The problem is that we want to generically jvp and tranpose over any reduction_fn. Jax already handles some of the hard parts for us, namely, ensuring that the user provided fn is jax capturable. All that is left then, is to write a jvp and tranpose fn that utilize the jax utils correctly.

However, this is not so straightforward because in order to get the transpose of a reduction window, we need to be able to use both the tangents and primals. The current reduce_fn operates on (x, y) - but we actually need is, under jvp, to operate on `(x_primal, y_primal, x_tangent, y_tangent)`. In turn, this means we need to push down notions of a jvp-specific reduction_fn (captured via the usual machinery of as_fun `as_fun(jvp_fn(closed(user_reduction_jaxp)))`).

For the jvp fn, we stack the primal operand and the tangent operand together, and we stack their respective initial values together - this means a good deal of changes to safety checks and assurances downstream (as well as unpacking) as the shape of the operand has changed from [K,...Kt] to [K, ...Kt, 2] where the last dim is the stacked primal and tangent values.

In following CLs, we will add (1) re-entrant/recursive is_jvp and (2) transposition

"Refactor JAX CPU kernels to make them usable from C++.

Most of the work here is porting the LAPACK interface from Cython to plain C++. This is something I wanted to do anyway to make use of C++ templating facilities: the code is noticeably shorter in C++.

This change removes the only use of Cython in JAX. It also removes the need for a build-time dependency on Scipy, which we only needed for Cython cimport reasons.

When using C++, we most likely do not want to fetch LAPACK and BLAS kernels from Python. Therefore we add another option: we define the LAPACK functions we need using weak symbols where supported; the user can then simply link against LAPACK to provide the necessary symbols.

Added a jaxlib:cpu_kernels module to facilitate using the JAX CPU kernels from C++.

This change may break code that depends on the current (undocumented and unintentional) behavior of `jnp.array()` to perform shape or index calculations that must be known statically (at trace time). The workaround for such cases is to use classic NumPy to perform shape/index calculations.

Added jax.numpy.insert implementation ( ).
Breaking Changes
jax.api has been removed. Functions that were available as jax.api.*
were aliases for functions in jax.*; please use the functions in
jax.* instead.
jax.partial, jax.lax.partial, and jax.util.partial were accidental
exports that have now been removed. Use functools.partial from the Python
standard library instead.
Boolean scalar indices now raise a TypeError; previously this silently
returned wrong results ( ).
Many more jax.numpy functions now require array-like inputs, and will error
if passed a list ( ).
See  for a discussion of the rationale behind this change.
When inside a transformation such as jax.jit, jax.numpy.array always
stages the array it produces into the traced computation. Previously
jax.numpy.array would sometimes produce a on-device array, even under
a jax.jit decorator. This change may break code that used JAX arrays to
perform shape or index computations that must be known statically; the
workaround is to perform such computations using classic NumPy arrays
instead.
jnp.ndarray is now a true base-class for JAX arrays. In particular, this
means that for a standard numpy array x, isinstance(x, jnp.ndarray) will
now return False ()."

Add fast path args to Array similar to GDA to speed up initialization and other operations like calculating indices and addressable_device_assignment.

This is important because looping over 1000s of devices is extremely expensive during runtime and throttles the performance (all these optimizations were applied to GDA when integrating it into PAX and are applicable to Array as well). This will also be helpful for single-controller environments.

Also even hashing and __eq__ checks when you have 1000s of devices is going to be slow and will show up in xprof as a slowdown (I have seen this before).

require scalar key arrays when seeding, splitting, and folding

Recent changes to RNG internals actually make it easier for us to
render these operations batch-polymorphic. However, any existing use
of these in a non-scalar way suggests incorrect usage, since they were
scalar-only before (albeit imperfectly guarded as such).

Enable cuBLASLt by default in XLA for most matmuls

Enable cuBLASLt by default in XLA with two exceptions. First, the current XLA implementation using cublasLt does not yet support int8 gemms. Second, the cublasLt api does not support a certain dimension size larger than a specific value; in this case we fallback to legacy cublas. This change makes a modification so that we prefer to do the cublaslt gemm operation in place when fusing with a bias add. Updated JAX test precision for new matmul results.

Make `__iter__` of `Array` behave like DA when there is a SingleDeviceSharding and like SDA when there is a non-trivial sharding.

This is important because when `Array` contains more than 1 shard, each shard can be on a different device and those things need to be preserved when iterating over `Array`.

[jax2tf] Refactor top-level jax2tf.convert

There are several goals for this refactoring:
  * improve the readability of the code: more helper functions, move big
    nested functions to top-level make make it obvious what are the
    data dependencies
  * try to be more systematic about naming: JAX entities end with _jax
    and TF entities with _tf. This is helpful because in several cases
    one function has to operate with both kinds of entities.
  * the main goal is to enable fixing the experimental_native_lowering
    for pjit. For that (future) work, we want to pass JAX callables
    to _interpret_fun_jax, rather than linear_util.WrappedFun. Then
    we can use the standard AOT APIs.

Use reduce_window for faster cumulative reductions on small inputs on GPU.

On GPU, reduce_window is executed in a single fusion and associative_scan
is split into multiple to materialize intermediate calculations.
On small inputs reduce_window is faster being a single fusion,
but on larger ones is slower because of O(n^2) complexity.
The conservative value of the threshold to choose between the two algorithms was obtained by benchmarking.

This is part of a suite of refactorings aimed towards supporting
pjit by jax2tf experimental_native_lowering. The goal here is

use the AOT APIs: jax.jit(func_jax).lower(*args).

[jax2tf] Updates to the documentation

One change I made throughout is to use the verb lower instead of
convert when refering to what jax2tf does. This is more accurate,
because what is happening is that the lowering to HLO is replaced
with a lowering to TF ops. Some users were confused by the use
of the verb convert as suggesting some sort of source-to-source
translation of JAX programs to TF, which sounds very complicated
and risky.
[jax2tf] Fixes a bug in gather (enable_xla=False)

For batched gather, we only support 1 batch dimension in the output. but in this case we were only collapsing a single dimension. However, if there are multiple `collapsed_slice_dims`, all of them should be collapsed. We can simply solve this by reshaping to the desired output shape.

Change TensorFlow to depend on StableHLO instead of vendoring it

This makes handling TensorFlow's dependency on StableHLO consistent with handling other TensorFlow's dependencies. For example, LLVM goes into //third_party/llvm, and so should StableHLO.

Users of tensorflow/tensorflow (e.g. JAX) need to change Bazel builds, replacing `@org_tensorflow//tensorflow/compiler/xla/mlir_hlo/stablehlo` with `@stablehlo//`. Nothing else changes, e.g. C++ includes, C++ usage, Python bindings and Python usage all stay the same. Example: https://github.com/google/jax/pull/12174.

Users of tensorflow/mlir-hlo are unaffected thanks to the awesome power of Copybara. There are minor changes in the StableHLO part of MLIR-HLO caused by the fact that the StableHLO repository and the vendored StableHLO inside tensorflow/tensorflow have diverged a little bit (e.g. Markdown formatting is slightly different between repositories because I didn't have the time to propagate these changes) and now they have been forced to converge, but these changes won't affect the behavior of neither CMake nor Bazel builds of MLIR-HLO.

Moving forward, contributions to StableHLO will only be possible through openxla/stablehlo. This is because tensorflow/tensorflow no longer vendors StableHLO. (tensorflow/mlir-hlo still does, but it's readonly).

The issue was that partial_eval.py's _memoize, used in custom_jvp, was made

references to the main trace (needed for the jvp_jaxpr thunk) and hence trigger
the leak checker (which would see if any references to the main trace persisted
after finishing tracing of the user function).

But after, the leak checker should only trigger when actual Tracers are
leaked. So disabling the memoization when jax_check_tracer_leaks is no longer
active shouldn't be necessary. (These PR numbers seem out of order! We're not
sure why.)

A recent XLA change allows XLA to use excess precision on GPU, which caused CompileAndCheck to report noticeable numerical changes for bfloat16.

In passing, also enable the comparison against NumPy test for bfloat16 by using a wrapper function.

Jax and jaxlib 0.3.18 release candidate.
Add initial jax.Array base class for instance checks & annotation
Lowerable checks!!
Remove unused _remat_static_argnums import.
lowerable errors behind a config flag.","GitHub commits.
Changes
Ahead-of-time lowering and compilation functionality (tracked in
{jax-issue}) is stable and public. See the
overview and the API docs
for {mod}jax.stages.
Introduced {class}jax.Array, intended to be used for both isinstance checks
and type annotations for array types in JAX. Notice that this included some subtle
changes to how isinstance works for {class}jax.numpy.ndarray for jax-internal
objects, as {class}jax.numpy.ndarray is now a simple alias of {class}jax.Array.
Breaking changes
jax._src is no longer imported into the from the public jax namespace.
This may break users that were using JAX internals.
jax.soft_pmap has been deleted. Please use pjit or xmap instead.
jax.soft_pmap is undocumented. If it were documented, a deprecation period
would have been provided."

"ceph: re-enable config overrides for osds

ceph: stop creating initial crushmap

This commit does:

* remove dead code SetCrushTunables()
* stop creating initial crushmap

There is no need to create an initial crushmap, since Ceph natively does
that for us.
We don't delete the existing configmap containing the initial crush map
of already deployed cluster, perhaps people are using for whatever
reason. It does not harm to keep it around.

ceph: adjust M-to-Mi rounding in PV creation

Example of failure scenarios:

   - requested PVC 500M = 500,000,000 bytes
   - PV is created as:
        (500M / 2**20)Mi = ""476""Mi
        But 476Mi = 476 * 2**20 = 499122176 < 500M

From the k8s documentation:

   Claims will remain unbound indefinitely if a matching volume does not
   exist. Claims will be bound as matching volumes become available. For
   example, a cluster provisioned with many 50Gi PVs would not match a
   PVC requesting 100Gi. The PVC can be bound when a 100Gi PV is added
   to the cluster.

which is inline with the behavior observed in which a 500M PVC is never
bound. However, the documentation also states:

   If a PV was dynamically provisioned for a new PVC, the loop will
   always bind that PV to the PVC. Otherwise, the user will always get
   at least what they asked for

which suggests that an _explicit_ binding can be created, and perhaps
something has changed with respect to this binding that has caused the
failures in newer versions of k8s.

the resource being an outdated version. This frequently occurs when
the same reconcile loop updates the status multiple times, or the finalizer
is added, or some other update to the resource. Upon the next reconcile
the error would generally go away since the status or finalizer didn't
need to be updated multiple times. But now the error is not expected
since the controller will retrieve the latest version of the resource

ceph: skip reconcile events where the spec not updated

The controllers should ignore events for status updates. The reconcile
only needs to happen when the spec is updated or the resource is marked
for deletion. Otherwise, the controllers may stay in an update loop as
the reconcile events are triggered again every time there is a status
update during the reconcile.

ceph: make admin key optional for external cluster

Currently, we need to configure the Ceph external Admin keyi
in the Rook deployment to be able to connect to an external Ceph cluster.
If we wanted to run in a multi-tenant fashion
were several K8s/Rook clusters wanted to connect to the same external ceph cluster,
each K8s deployment would have the access to the External Ceph Admin key
and could potentially access or delete the Data
from pools that belong to other k8s/Rook Clusters.

Now the admin key is optional but the helper script create-external-cluster-resources.sh
will help create the necessary keys/users to connect to that cluster.

core: node fencing, skip pv when pv is not backed by csi

when node fencing is triggered and a negative case where
one deployment pod consuming pv not provisioned by csi
and another deployment pod with rbd rwo are on the same

In this case rook operator panics since it is trigger to get

multus: revise kube config/client loading

The previous client loader routine assumed KUBECONFIG would be set in
CLI environments. Instead, now take this approach:

1. If KUBECONFIG is set, that is the de-facto override that informs the
   tool it is being run in a CLI environment.
2. Otherwise, try creating a client from the default kube config file.
3. If that fails, assume the tool is running in a Kubernetes Pod.

This will continue supporting dev/test environments so that building the
rook container is not necessary for development. It also allows support
for highly opinionated environments (like deployed by OpenShift CSVs)
where it's not possible to install the Rook operator without also
deploying a CephCluster.

operator: silence 'cm is handled by another watcher' DEBUG messages

I guesstimate that around 50% of the operator log volume when set to log
level `DEBUG` are messages about cm's which aren't relevant to rook.

E.g.:

```
2022-09-16 23:03:05.430839 D | ceph-cluster-controller: hot-plug cm watcher: only reconcile on hot plug cm changes, this ""ingress-controller-leader"" cm is handled by another watcher
2022-09-16 23:03:05.643255 D | ceph-cluster-controller: hot-plug cm watcher: only reconcile on hot plug cm changes, this ""fleet-agent-lock"" cm is handled by another watcher
2022-09-16 23:03:05.799526 D | ceph-cluster-controller: hot-plug cm watcher: only reconcile on hot plug cm changes, this ""cattle-controllers"" cm is handled by another watcher
```

Yes, it is `DEBUG` and noise is expected. However, there is no message
about checking the status of the cm's rook actually needs to watch and
these messages don't seem very useful. I have been resorting to piping
the operators logs through `| grep -v 'hot-plug cm watcher'` to cut down
the noise.

csi: make sure we reset CSIParam booleans to default

On removing or setting params to false in operator config map, make sure
to set CSIParam to their appropriate defaults, since we are not restarting the
operator we cannot just assume these params/variables/flags are defaulted,
everytime we need to makesure some defaults are specified.

This is what happens without these changes:
* Set CSI_ENABLE_METADATA to true, this will tune CSIParam.CSIEnableMetadata
  to true from false
* Create a PVC and check the metadata is added to the rbd/cephfs volumes
* Now Set CSI_ENABLE_METADATA to false, we assume CSIParam.CSIEnableMetadata
  will be set to false, but that is not happening because the earlier value
  of `CSIParam.CSIEnableMetadata = true` still persist.
  (we are not restarting operator to assume value of CSIParam.CSIEnableMetadata
   to be reset to false)

This happens with CSI_ENABLE_OMAP_GENERATOR and many other flags too,
fixing them all with these changes.

Thanks to Madhu for debugging the issue and testing it along.

ceph: use cacert if no client cert/key are present

We have seen issues with fullchain.pem files containing one self-signed
certificate. At the same time, the failing configuration was not
providing any client certificates or keys.

The error from curl was `""self signed certificate in the chain""`.

The openssl binary is not available so we cannot even c_rehash the
certificate directory when using `--capath`, however this worked already
with a fully signed fullchain.pem along with a client certificate and
key. So we cannot only use `--cacert` which will break that use case.

This is becoming really obscur on why using `--cacert` solves this
problem. I just can't wait to use the `vault` binary, that's all I can
say...

operator: set 'rook-version' in mon k/v store

Ceph upstream telemetry (which Rook users could optionally enable via
Ceph CLI or Dashboard) does not easily identify if a cluster is managed
by Rook. Identifying Rook clusters is possible only if users also enable
the rook mgr module, which is optional and not often used.

To get better upstream insights into Ceph clusters managed by Rook, set
a new 'rook-version' field in Ceph's generic k/v store. This field can
be used to determine if a cluster is managed by Rook by its presence.
It additionally provides information about the Rook version used to
manage the cluster, which is another piece of potentially useful
information.

Regarding Ceph cluster identification via telemetry:
Ceph telemetry is anonymous and uses a different ID from the Ceph
cluster ID. Identifying the Rook version in telemetry does not add
directly identifying information. Therefore, there should be little
risk that adding the Rook version field will decrease anonymity of Ceph
clusters via telemetry.

The cluster CR doc is extremely long and in need of refactoring.
Now we have four new sub-topics for a host-based cluster,
PVC-based cluster, stretch cluster, and an external cluster.
Each of those topics has its own description and examples.
The main cluster CR topic still contains the details about
all the possible cluster CR settings.

monitoring: allow overriding monitoring labels

The templates for the mgr-generated ServiceMonitor and PrometheusRule objects included the labels
prometheus and team, making it impossible to override them as user.

This adds a new method `OverwriteApplyToObjectMeta` to pkg/apis/rook.io.Labels,
which, contrary to the existing `ApplyToObjectMeta` method, overwrites existing
labels.

also add an ingress into the helm integration tests so any regressions to how ingresses

ceph: preserve volume claim template annotations during upgrade

The upgrade of the csv is failing to the latest schema when
the crushDeviceClass is specified and when the volumeClaimTemplate
annotations do not preserve the unknown fields. To fix the upgrade,
we preserve the fields even though it should not be necessary
from the strict schema.

ceph: fix intermittent volume unit test

The unit test TestConfigureCVDevices was failing intermittently
due to comparing the first element of the slice of two elements.
The slice ordering is not guaranteed, which caused a failure
intermittently. The test only compares the critical values in the test
and no need to check elements of the slice.

ceph: allow setting primary-affinity to osd

A user with unbalanced system (e.g., some OSDs use a partition which
resides on a device along-side OS partition) may want to have a
fine-grained control on the overall load of specific OSD. While osd
weight affects write-load, primary-affinity affects read-load.

This patch allow user to define osd's primary-affinity (similar to
'DeviceClass' and 'InitialWeight'), which is sent to the osd (via mon)
as part of deployment sequence, using 'ceph osd primary-affinity' command.

Valid values are within the range [0.0, 1.0). If not set, default value
is 1.

external: add realm support for external cluster

if a cluster won't use the deafult realm and try to
execute the python script it will fail to vaildate rgw
as the rgw-admin-user would be created on default realm
So creating user in specific realm if the realm name is passed

object: make OBC genUserID unique across clusters

Rook's implementation of OBC's GenerateUserID could generate colliding
user IDs for multisite clusters where each site is configured with the
same namespace/name of CephObjectStore. Add the Ceph cluster FSID to the
generated name to ensure the names won't conflict for multiple sites.

monitoring: remove alerts that don't apply to rook

When the alerts were updated from the ceph repo, the cephadm
alerts were removed, now we also remove two other alerts that
don't apply to rook clusters. The pool growth warning alert
and prometheus job missing alerts need to be removed
as also seen in https://github.com/rook/rook/pull/10109.

ceph: ability to abort orchestration

We can now prioritize orchestrations on certain event. Today only two
events will cancel on-going orchestrations (if any):

* request for cluster deletion
* request for cluster upgrade

If one of the two are caught by the watcher we will cancel the on-going
orchestration.
For that we implemented a simple approach based on check points, where
we will check for a cancellation request in certain part of the
orchestration. Mainly before each mons/mgr/osds orchestration loops.

This solution is not perfect, but we are waiting for the
controller-runtime to release its 0.7 version which will embed context
support. With that we will be able to cancel reconciles more precisely
and rapidly.

mon: fix bind addr when IPv6 and msgr2 are enabled

When IPv6-only network mode is enabled and when mons are configured to
listen only on msgrV2 port, Rook has to add the port to the mon
--public-bind-addr in order to force mons to stop listening on the
msgrV1 port. This can cause problems for IPv6 clusters where adding
':<port>' to the end of an IP addr looks like a valid IPv6 address.

In IPv6 mode, Rook needs to set this to '[<ip>]:<port>' with the
brackets to be a non-ambiguous IPv6 address.

In IPv4 mode, Rook needs to keep its existing behavior. IPv4 mode should
also continue to be the defualt assumption if the network config isn't
specified.

If 'dualStack: true' is specified, Rook is informed that the environment
is dual stack, but Rook doesn't know which IP family to expect from the
pod IP. In this scenario, it is safest for Rook not to apply the port,
since assuming either IPv4 or IPv6 format could be incorrect. In this
scenario, mons may still listen on msgrV1 ports, but this is preferable
to an environment where mons perpetually crash.

"Do not print out `remote/HEAD` refs

Note: we filter these in the graph view as well
Decouple branches from their descriptions

We only read and display the descriptions in the dashboard.  We also
need two independent git calls.

Decouple here so we can cache the result of `get_branches` in the store.
Cache `branches` in the store
Suppress upstream if up-to-date with local branch
Stop if HEAD has only semver tags
More versatile parsing of the decoration string
Explicitly handle the empty string case
Spelling
Slight refactor into different functions
Fix status dashboard tests to not throw ugly

They were green actually but the unmocked git calls added noise to the
logs.
Remove unused `reset_cursor` methods

Unused since 1a6d43c7 (Remove `nuke_cursors` argument)
Implement reactive branch dashboard
Cache branch descriptions in the store
Beware nulls in the store and provide defaults
Extract reactive bits into `ui.ReactiveInterface`
Do a deepcopy of the state for later comparison

In the tags dashboard we have a deeper/nested state object.  Prepare for
that and do a deep copy to check for a changed state.
Put `cursor_is_on_something` onto `ui.Interface`
Ensure cursor lands on the active branch for new views

With a cold cache opening a new branches dashboard is too async for
`on_new_dashboard` to makes sense.

Move the cursor fix to the `keep_cursor_on_something` hook instead.
Simplify selectors to navigate the branches dashboard
Add return type annotations to `ui.ReactiveInterface`
Make tags a reactive dashboard
Simplify `gs_tags_navigate_tag`'s selector
Invent proper return type `TagList`
Cache `local_tags` in the store
Cache `remotes` in the store
Directly store `long_status` and `short_status` in the store
Let the status bar subscribe to `short_status`
Remove `short_status` and `long_status` from `WorkingDirState`
Never unpack `status` into the store
Sort branches in python land
Simplify the `__init__`s

We already init in `refresh_view_state`.  We still need to fill in
`show_remotes` as that is set only once (""initially"").
Cleanup state refreshing

Since now all relevant state flows through the store (and we subscribe
to it), it is not necessary to call `update_state` manually.  We get
notified.
Optimize initial status render
Abort less obtrusive for typical runtime errors

Print short, user-friendly error message and traceback for runtime
errors.  These include ""View already detached"" errors, and typically
assertion errors.
Optimize initial tags dashboard render
Centralize initializing the global and local state
Automatically inject state values into the render functions
No null objects just missing keys

With the new status injection we automatically do not render a section
if its dependency is not ready.

In case of multiple dependencies we wait for all of them!
Add types to everything
Do not wait for the branch descriptions

Typically users don't do branch descriptions, and the `branches` we
likely have preloaded.  Hence do not wait for an immediate response.
Move remote tag fetching out of the render phase
Inject more state into `get_remote_tags_list`
Ensure a newline during first render

... before the help and before `remotes` has been populated
Fix remote tags filter

For the remote tags we only show tags we don't already show in the local
section.  We used to compare the `sha`s only here but of course there
can be multiple tags on the same commit.

We construct new tuples here just for the comparison because the local
tags also come with datetimes.  A simple `tag in seen` is therefore
not possible.
Do not clear ""remote_tags"" when hiding the section
Ensure to fetch remote tags after `remotes` has been populated

`maybe_populate_remote_tags` depends on `remotes` so order matters here,
especially for the initial render.
Special mark new and changes tags in the dashboard
Do not write to the state concurrently
Draw markers once all remotes have been fetched

The marks we draw evaluate *all* known remote tags.  Waiting for
settlement prohibits that we draw intermediate results.
Fix `gs_tags_show_graph` not going to annotated tags

For annotated tags we actually show the sha of that tag object in the
dashboard.  This sha is not present in the graph.  Instead of resolving
the commit sha just search for the `tag: ...`.
Clarify when we need a full render

After the hotfix 3266859a (Fix `blame` not rendering anything) we do a
fresh render whenever `regions` becomes empty which is not necessary
(and a bit confusing).  Rewrite that passage for clarity:

We need a full render whenever we have sections not currently drawn;
and also when we haven't drawn any sections at all in the previous
round.  The latter implies `not regions`.

In other words: Instead of `not regions` *or* `not current_region_names`
*and* would have been correct.

Add tests because I did this wrong 3 times now.
Fix navigation to the first section in the inline diff

For the first jumpable region, we try to show the BOF which is only
correct for views that have a header section at the top.

Inline diffs don't and so we shouldn't do anything particular as well.
Note that the historical file view (which is similar in that it shows a
whole file without headers) never did this as well.","This is a follow up to v2.38.0.  Tabbing through the dashboards should now finally be instantaneous.  And the new
recent commits sections had some optics fine tuning. See for a before/after pic,
Some minor fixes in the tags dashboard and a small improvement:  new, unpushed tags now have a * in front of them.
If you see a ! instead it means that sha's between the local and the remote tag do not match.
Fixed also a small scrolling annoyance when navigating an inline diff."
"Improve syntax file parsing

Fixes

For a lot of files `yaml.safe_load` fails if the lib does not support
the used yaml format.  It is also very slow to parse all syntax files.

Since we only use relatively simple information here, t.i. a single
key, we just run a regex and extract the useful information.
Parse "".tmLanguage"" syntax files for ""fileTypes""

Fixes

Note: for the least surprise we first parse the ""tmLanguage"" files,
followed by ""sublime-syntax"" so that the latter overrule the former.

Note: we don't have any way to tell which is the currently preferred
syntax.  We just use the last syntax we iterated over.
Guess the syntax by looking for an open view

Since we cannot actually know the correct syntax just by looking at
our map, we just choose the arbitrary `[-1]` last item, we try harder
to just take the syntax using an open view.

If we ever found such a syntax we also remember this choice.
Normalize paths coming from the status views

In the status view we show short relative paths to a file. These come
from git and thus have always ""/"" as the path separator.

Since we construt absolute paths here, we should also `normpath`.
Fallback to the standard ""markdown"" syntax for the help
Normalize line endings when reading help docs

The help docs are saved with mac line endings. We convert to plain
""\n"" newline characters because that's internally the format Sublime
uses and wants.","Improve syntax selection for the ""inline diff"" (gs_inline_diff) and ""historical file view"" (gs_show_file_at_commit)

cue/parser: allow full expressions for embeddings

This completes the implementation of the spec
allowing expressions for embeddings.

It also lifts the restriction in the spec.

Futher relaxing would be possible, but requires
lookahead.

Not that this is not unlike the Go ambiguity:
if foo == myStruct{} {
}
where parenthesis are required around the struct
literal.

Closes.
