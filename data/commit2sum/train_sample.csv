[security] enforce process limits at a per-container level to avoid abusive clients impacting other instances
Apply container limits to install containers, defaulting to minimums if the server's resources are set too low
Update CHANGELOG.md","Added
[security] Adds support for limiting the total number of pids any one container can have active at once to prevent malicious users from impacting other instances on the same node.
Server install containers now use the limits assigned to the server, or a globally defined minimum amount of memory and CPU rather than having unlimited resources.

Reduce the size of the buffered reader to improve CPU performance","Fixed
Rewrote handler logic for the power actions lock to hopefully address issues people have been having when a server crashes and they're unable to start it again until restarting Wings.
Fixes files uploaded with SFTP not being owned by the Pterodactyl user.
Fixes excessive memory usage when large lines are sent through the console event handler.
Changed
Replaced usage of encoding/json throughout the codebase with a more performant encoder (goccy/go-json) to hopefully improve overall performance for JSON operations.
Added custom ContainerInspect function to handle direct calls to Docker's CLI and make use of the new JSON encoder logic. This should reduce the total number of memory allocations and be more performant overall in a hot pathway.

Update CHANGELOG.md","Changed
Release binaries are now built with Go 1.18.10
Timeout when stopping a server before a transfer begins has been reduced to 15 seconds from 1 minute
Removed insecure SSH protocols for use with the SFTP server
Fixed
Unnecessary Docker client connections being left open, causing a slow leak of file descriptors
Files being left open in parts of the server's filesystem, causing a leak of file descriptors
IPv6 addresses being corrupted by flawed port stripping logic for activity logs, old entries with malformed IPs will be deleted from the local SQLite database automatically
A server that times out while being stopped at the beginning of a transfer no longer causes the server to become stuck in a transferring state

Fixed multiplication suppl. info to plot
Updated addon screenshots
Do not check setting if enabled

This check is not necessary becouse this function is executed by a
settings action that depend from mylist_library_sync setting

And causes the inability to start synchronization if
mylist_library_sync is activated at the same time without close the
settings screen
Sync changes made to tvshows in my list from other apps
Fixed wrong get_tvshows_id_list query
Added notification to completed library sync
Added owner/kids info to profiles descriptions
Force to use owner account profile to sync mylist

synchronization only on the main profile

in the future you can also implement an option to decide which profile
to synchronize the mylist
Enabled export NFOs on sync mylist to kodi library
Some fixes to translations
Updated italian translation
AuthURL is changed while the profile change is executed

Seem the cause of error:

HTTPError: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url:
https://www.------.com/api/shakti/v7bb27746/playlistop

when try to add/remove to mylist after switching to another profile
Clean and fixed generate esn

now manufacturer string is limited to 5 char
example with nvidia shield:
ro.product.manufacturer = 'NVIDIA'
ro.product.model = 'Shield android tv'
ro.nrdp.modelgroup = 'SHIELDANDROIDTV'
esn output:
old: NFANDROID2-PRV-SHIELDANDROIDTV-NVIDIASHIELD=ANDROID=TV

Fixed wrong cache identifier
Fixed videoid error when play a trailer

Other fixes"
"Update CHANGELOG.md
Improve support for block/mutex contention in pprof
Fix panic condition when no response is returned
Return context cancelations as a locker locked error
Pass a context through to the start/stop/terminate actions
Fix logic for context based environment stopping

Uses dual contexts to handle stopping using a timed context, and also terminating the entire process loop if the parent context gets canceled.
Add additional debug points to server start process
Fix failing test
Move the sink pool to be a shared tool
Simplify the event bus system; address pterodactyl/panel

If my debugging is correct, this should address pterodactyl/panel in its entirety by addressing a few areas where it was possible for a channel to lock up and cause everything to block
Don't trigger a panic condition decoding event stats; closes pterodactyl/panel
Remove unused function
Check for error before prefix; fixes abandoned routine; closes pterodactyl/panel

Due to the order of the previous logic in ScanReader, an error not caused by EOF would effectively get ignored since an error will always be returned with `isPrefix` equal to false, thus triggering the first break, and error checking is not performed beyond that point.

Thus, canceling an installation process for a server while this process was running would hang the routine and cause the loop to run endlessly, even with a canceled context.
Fix panic conditions","Fixed
Fixes error that would sometimes occur when starting a server that would cause the temporary power action lock to never be released due to a blocked channel.
Fixes a bug causing the CPU usage of Wings to get stuck at 100% when a server is deleted while the installation process is running.
Changed
Cleans up a lot of the logic for handling events between the server and environment process to make it easier to make modifications to down the road.
Cleans up logic handling the StopAndWait logic for stopping a server gracefully before terminating the process if it does not respond.

Sqlite connections and multi threads a way to solve

In the latest kodi builds a problem between shared connections between different threads has been highlighted, which was not present before or was present in a rare cases always on linux devices (RPI and some Android). I don't understand why the problem's only just come up now.

This problem seem to be affected low power devices, can happen more easily than sqlite read/write with the same connection so causing side-effects to the sqlite module.

The main problem is that sqlite doesn't really support shared connections by several different threads and mishandles multiple readings/writings at same time.
Updated readme
Properties must not be shared with multiple kodi profiles
Get list of profiles by api
Removed html parser from profile name
Fixed missing profile on first login
is_logged_in must not be internal method
Corrected description

A hack way to speed up requests made by requests module

This allows you to speed up the first request (made by requests module)

server(filesystem): fix archives in subdirectories

When creating an archive starting from a subdirectory instead of the
root of a server's filesystem, the walker would treat the paths as if
they where relative to the parent of the subdirectory, instead of as
descendants of the subdirectory.
